<p>The University of Milan-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will join Prof. Davide Gerosa and will constitute the core team of the &#8220;GWmining&#8221; project funded by the European Research Council. Targeted investigations include applications of machine-learning techniques to gravitational-wave physics, modeling of black-hole binary populations from their stellar progenitors, relativistic dynamics, and statistical inference. Candidates will have ample opportunities to explore other areas of gravitational-wave astronomy and will be encouraged to develop independent collaborations.</p>



<p>We anticipate awarding two positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>



<p>The astrophysics group at Milan-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: gravitational-wave astronomy, stellar evolution, relativistic astrophysics, general relativity, machine learning, statistical inference.</p>



<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>&nbsp;by December 1st, 2021 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent to the same address by December 1st, 2021. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>.</p>

Viola graduated from Rome &#8220;La Sapienza&#8221; with an MSc thesis on exotic compact objects and is now starting her PhD with me at Milan-Bicocca. Viola plays guitar, arguably better than Matt (although he runs for a million miles, and that&#8217;s when he&#8217;s tired), while Daria remains by far the best fencer in the group. Welcome, we all look forward to working with you!</p>

<p>It is a true honor to receive the career Prize for Young Researchers of the Italian Society for General Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV). I was awarded the prize in the class of relativistic astrophysics. It&#8217;s amazing to be recognized in my home country; it&#8217;s great to be back! Let me thank all my mentors, advisors, collaborators, and now students who are walking with me in the adventure of science.</p>



<p>Here is me with the president of the society Fulvio Ricci. And here are press releases from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/news/davide-gerosa-premio-assegnato-dalla-societ%C3%A0-italiana-relativit%C3%A0-generale-e-fisica-della" target="_blank">University of Milan-Bicocca</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.infn.it/it/news-infn/4527-sigrav-premiati-tre-giovani-ricercatori-infn-e-assegnata-a-heino-falcke-e-ad-andrzej-mariusz-trautman-la-medaglia-amaldi" target="_blank">INFN</a>. </p>

<p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka &#8220;parameter estimation&#8221;), all of them together (aka &#8220;population&#8221;), or each of them individually while they&#8217;re together. That&#8217;s what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, don&#8217;t do this at home.</p>

<p>Today we go deep into the perilous world of binary population synthesis! Using Nicola&#8217;s code <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" target="_blank">MOBSE</a>, our master student Maciej has implemented some new prescriptions for how supernovae explode and produce compact objects. In practice, we use the compactness (that&#8217;s mass over radius) of the stellar core before the explosion to decide if that specific star will form a neutron star or a black hole. This now needs to be compared carefully with gravitational-wave data, but we suggest that there are two key signatures one should look for: the lowest black hole masses and the relative merger rates between black holes and neutron stars.  </p>

<p>LISA is going to be great and will detect stuff from white dwarfs to those supermassive black-hole that live at the center of galaxies. If we&#8217;re lucky (yeah, who knows how many of these we will see), LISA might also detect some smaller black holes, similar to those that LIGO now sees all the time, but at a much earlier stage of their lives. But if we&#8217;re indeed lucky, the science we would take home is outstanding. Using simulated data from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lisa-ldc.lal.in2p3.fr/" target="_blank">LISA Data Challenge</a> we unleash the new amazing parameter-estimation code Balrog (don&#8217;t ask what it means, it&#8217;s just a name, not one of those surreal astronomy acronyms) at this problem. Dive into the paper for some real data-analysis fun!</p>
