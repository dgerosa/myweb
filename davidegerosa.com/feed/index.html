<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>



<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>



<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (“professore associato” in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>



<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>



<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>

<p>Hey Chris, just wanted to say thanks because you wanted to understand what was going on, thanks for taking me skiing, thanks for sending me yet another version of those files I had to postprocess, for those obscure comments in Polish you had in your code, thanks for that last long chat in Japan last month (I&#8217;ll finish that calculation we sketched at the board!), thanks for the energy. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re on a beautiful mountain.</p>

<p>Much like Spotify, here is our group &#8220;Wrapped&#8221;, 2023 edition!</p>



<p>Some of the group highlights include&#8230;  We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davide&#8217;s ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>



<p>&#8230; now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>
