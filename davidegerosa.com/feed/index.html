<p>Two students just completed their Bachelor&#8217;s degree with research projects in our group. Leonardo Toti worked with myself and Giulia Fumagalli on exploring black-hole merger trees in dense clusters, while Simone Restuccia worked with Costantino Pacilio on applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to black-hole ringdowns. I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them &#8220;physicists&#8221; for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial phase is imposing: &#8220;<em>coi poteri conferitami&#8230;</em>&#8220;). Congrats Simone and Leonardo! </p>

<p>Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Gravitational-wave populations: what&#8217;s next?</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s been a blast! </p>



<p>An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question &#8220;<em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?</em>&#8221; and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive. </p>



<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise I&#8217;ll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view. </p>



<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize. </p>



<p>And if you couldn&#8217;t make it for whatever reason no worries, we&#8217;ll do it again!</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.</strong> These are our discussion sessions</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Intro: the pieces of the population problem.</em></li>



<li><em>What can/should astrophysicists and pop-synthers predict?</em></li>



<li><em>What is the predictive power of pop-synth codes? Are we learning more than our assumptions?</em></li>



<li><em>Hierarchical Bayesian fits: can we keep on doing this? Technical difficulties, scaling with the number of events, selection effects.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the outliers. Are they in or out of your fit? If you fit something well you also need to fit the rest.</em></li>



<li><em>What is a catalog? Is p_astro the way to go? (Ir)relevance of subthreshold events.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the systematics. Are waveform/calibration impacting the population? And how about the assumed population?</em></li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;non-parametric&#8221; methods. What are they and what does it even mean</em>.</li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;parametric but informed&#8221;. Machine learning emulators for pop-synth.</em></li>



<li><em>More populations. LISA, X-ray binaries, Gaia, you name it.</em></li>



<li><em>More than individual mergers. Stochastic backgrounds, foreground removal.</em></li>



<li><em>Adding the redshift dimension: toward 3g! Use the population to do cosmology.</em></li>



<li><em>What&#8217;s next? Summary and prospects.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>New paper from a new student! Here is Matteo Boschini&#8217;s first piece of work, where we look at predictions for the final mass and spins of black-hole remnants. That is, after two black hole merge, what&#8217;s the mass and spin of the guy they left behind? These predictions are typically done by fitting (in various ways) outputs from numerical-relativity simulations but those, unfortunately, can only handle black holes of similar masses. On the other hand, black holes with masses that are very different from each other can be handled analytically. Here we show how to put the two together with a single machine-learning fit. </p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>All right, this is kind of far from my day-to-day topics but working on this paper with Alice and Riccardo was super fun. Think LISA and supermassive binary black holes. And&#8230; the detector does what it wants. That&#8217;s not true of course because the experimentalists are amazing, but there will be noise transients: unexpected blips when the gravitational-wave signal will be corrupted. Here we look at what would happen in a realistic setting when a LISA glitch happens on top of a gravitational wave from a supermassive black hole. </p>

<p>We do population analysis in gravitational waves all the time now. That is: we compare many observations from GW experiments against many simulated datapoints from simulations. But what if you only have one observation? That could be a LIGO guy that is kind of an outlier (think GW190521) or maybe a datapoint from a future detector (think LISA) that feels lonely in his parameter space. Don&#8217;t look further, this is stats for you (and Matt&#8217;s last paper as a grad student&#8230;)</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got the best name ever for a numerical code! Let me introduce QLUSTER which, guess what, simulates clusters. We finally put out a piece of code that was originally <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2019/06/14/escape-speed-of-stellar-clusters-from-multiple-generation-black-hole-mergers-in-the-upper-mass-gap/" data-type="post" data-id="2604">developed in 2019</a> and later used in several papers.  It&#8217;s a very very simple treatment of black-hole binary formation in dense stellar environments, with the goal of predicting gravitational waves from repeated mergers. The code is available at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mdmould/qluster" target="_blank">github.com/mdmould/qluster</a> and a short description is provided in the proceedings of the 2023 edition of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2023/Gravitation/" target="_blank">amazing Moriond conference</a>.</p>
