<p>Four BSc+MSc students just graduated with projects in our group!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Alessandro Malfasi completed his BSc project with Pippa Cole on combining PTA data and primordial black holes (a believer!).</li>



<li>Nicole Grillo got her MSc degree in Astrophysics with a project, also with Pippa Cole, on EMRIs and environmental effects.</li>



<li>Olga Pietrosanti also got her Astrophysics MSc today, and she works in collaboration with Alessandro Trani (Copenhagen), Evgeni Grishin (Monash, Australia), and Clement Bonnerot (Birmingham, UK) on black holes migrating in AGN disks.</li>



<li>Giovanni Giarda (&#8230;&#8221;<em>my name is Giovanni Giarda</em>&#8220;) completed his MSc project with Arianna Renzini and Costantino Pacilio on a deep learning pipeline to speed up the computation of GW stochastic backgrounds.</li>
</ul>



<p>&#8230; congrats all!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational-wave physics, our 2025 call for PhD scholarships is now available. The procedure is described here (Session 1):</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.  </p>



<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>&#8220;Guide to filling in the online application.&#8221;</em> There&#8217;s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you&#8217;re interested in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3. </p>



<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you&#8217;ve done already. Hope this helps!</p>



<p>For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me: <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>The Italian Society of General Relativity and Gravitation (SIGRAV) announces the 26th SIGRAV Conference, hosted by the University of Milano-Bicocca, to be held in Milan, Italy, from September 8-12, 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025</a></p>



<p>The conference will cover various aspects of classical and quantum gravity, including tests of General Relativity, cosmology, gravity experiments, and gravitational waves from experimental, theoretical, and data-analysis perspectives.</p>



<p>Participation is open to SIGRAV members and non-members alike, both nationally and internationally. The program will feature a series of broad review talks on various aspects of gravitational physics, as well as contributed talks. The SIGRAV Amaldi medals, the SIGRAV prizes for young researchers, and the Giulio Rampa PhD thesis prize will be awarded during the conference. There will also be a public event dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914.</p>



<p>Abstracts for contributed talks should submitted by May 31, 2025. We aim to announce the full conference program by the end of June. Registrations will be accepted until July 15, 2025.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; you can also explore nearby lakes or venture into the stunning Alps.</p>

<p>When inferring black holes from gravitational-wave data, we tend to do two things, one after the other. First, we consider each event individually and measure its parameters (masses, spins, etc). Then we consider all the events together and measure the population properties. This is what we do all the time, but, actually, if objects are now part of a population, those parameters should be looked at again in light of all the others. This full problem (all parameters of all the events plus the population parameters) is daunting, and <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2021/08/06/population-informed-priors-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy/" data-type="post" data-id="4498">in the past</a> we used an indirect and somewhat convoluted approach. We got back to it now, and this time, we managed to do it head-on. Let me introduce this giant 500-dimensional sampling of the full population problem! </p>

<p>Long gravitational-was signals are, well, long. And long often means painful, as more data need to be stored and processed. Kind of intuitively, the solution might be that of cutting things into chunks, so that long becomes short. Here we apply this idea to the popular inner product entering all gravitational-wave pipelines; this is a key building block of everything we do. The answer is that using SFTs, &#8220;Short-time Fourier Transforms&#8221;, can make things faster by more than 3 orders of magnitudes, sometimes 5. We think this is <em>the</em> solution to future gravitational-wave data analysis problems (think LISA and 3G&#8230;).</p>

<p>General relativity has this beautiful property that coordinates are meaningless. You can change them at will, which means they don&#8217;t contain any physics. And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but that&#8217;s killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself. The paper is on the maths-heavy side of things, but the results are great. Peters, you were basically right, but not quite.</p>

<p>Quasar 3C 186 strikes back! Matteo and I got interested in this funny quasar last year (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/02/16/astrophysical-and-relativistic-modeling-of-the-recoiling-black-hole-candidate-in-quasar-3c-186/" data-type="post" data-id="5769">see this one</a>). When our paper hit the arxiv, we got contacted by the real astronomers who take actual data, who told us they had even more beautiful data. We ended up contributing with our relativistic model and&#8230; well&#8230; everything seems to work. 3C 186 is indeed a recoiling black hole (it might be a rare one, but we&#8217;ve observed it nonetheless). The abstract says &#8220;decisive,&#8221; and this is indeed the right word.</p>
