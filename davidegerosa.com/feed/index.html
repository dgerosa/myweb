<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. This year&#8217;s application deadline is May 14th, 2024 (noon CEST) for positions starting in the Fall of 2024:</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>In particular, we are looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics and gravitational-wave data exploitation. Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational-wave physics, covering activities ranging from astrophysical/numerical modeling to data analysis. The group counts 7 faculty members (Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Sesana, and an upcoming new hire) together with several postdocs (of which two prize fellows) and PhD students. Candidates will also have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators.</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of “open” scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, we are advertising an additional “project” scholarship titled “Gravitational-wave source modeling” which will be supervised by Prof. Davide Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this opportunity must indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.8). For more information on Gerosa&#8217;s group see www.davidegerosa.com/group</p>



<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. For informal inquiries, expressions of interest, and application tips please do not hesitate to contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>Three more students graduated in March with research projects completed in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/">group</a>!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Pedrotti defended his MSc thesis working with Michele Mancarella on gravitational-wave cosmology going from crazy calculations to fun correlations and all the way to Einstein Telescope! Alessandro is now moving on with his career with a research placement at the University of Aix-Marseille. Congrats! </li>



<li>Annalisa Amigoni completed a BSc project with Ssohrab: more fun with 3g detectors&#8230;</li>



<li>Alice Palladino also completed a BSc project; she worked with Viola and me on a strange and mind-twisting &#8220;ordering&#8221; problem using the LIGO posterior (how many times did we get confused on this!)</li>

<p>And the second paper on the arxiv today is Daria&#8217;s masterpiece! pAGN (which Daria says you should read &#8220;pagan&#8221;) is a brand new, super cool code that implements the hydrodynamics of AGN disks, at least in their most popular one-dimensional fashion. Those solutions have been around for a long time but their details were, well, let&#8217;s say unclear. Daria went through everything from beginning to end, coming up with the &#8220;one-stop solution for your AGN disc needs&#8221; (that was actually the working title of the paper&#8230;). So <a href="https://github.com/DariaGangardt/pAGN">pip install pAGN</a> and have fun.    </p>

<p>This is the first of two papers on the arxiv today: it&#8217;s fun when two long, very different projects by different people just happen to be done on the same day! This paper is by my former colleague Nate Steinle (now a postdoc in Manitoba, Canada). Here we connect the dynamics of jets in AGN disks to the spin of black holes observable by LISA. And show the latter is a diagnostic of the former! And it&#8217;s nice to see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/04/08/the-bardeen-petterson-effect-in-accreting-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-a-systematic-approach/" data-type="post" data-id="3165">my disk-binary</a> code being used for something I didn&#8217;t think of when I wrote it.</p>

<p>Our student Lisa Merlo defended her BSc 3rd year project today! Lisa worked with Pippa Cole and me on computing rates for mergers of primordial black holes, also considering a new detector prototype that the experimental group here is developing (nickname <a href="https://bicoq.fisica.unimib.it/">BAUSCIA</a>, from the Milan dialect). Short answer: the rate is low but now is more accurately low. Lisa&#8217;s presentation was amazing and working with her has been a real pleasure. Stay tuned for her future astro career!</p>

<p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em>&#8230; Call me an ambulance.</p>



<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because it&#8217;s not centered on the galaxy (it&#8217;s a bit off) and it&#8217;s also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered it&#8217;s all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found that&#8230; mmh, well, it&#8217;s a maybe.  </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>



<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>



<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (“professore associato” in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>



<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>



<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>
