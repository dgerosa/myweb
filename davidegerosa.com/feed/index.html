<p>This is a fun IMBH story we worked out when Kostas and Luca <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/07/16/many-visitors/" data-type="post" data-id="6083">were visiting</a> last summer from JHU. What if (one day, who knows) we observe a highly spinning intermediate-mass black hole? If that happens, is going to be puzzling because IMBH that grow in clusters by mergers of smaller black holes tend to spin down, not up. This is a funny property of black holes, namely that extracting spins is easier than putting it in, so on average black holes slow down after they have merged many times. So if we see an IMBH with large spins, the spin must come from somewhere else. Where? Maybe gas. The argument then is that one can actually convert an IMBH spin measurement into the minimum amount of gas that must have been accreted to get that spin. </p>

<p>Four students just graduated with projects in our group&#8230; </p>



<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2022/02/23/congrats-cecilia/" data-type="post" data-id="4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, it&#8217;s always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit you&#8217;ll tell me everything I don&#8217;t understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>



<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Pagani worked with Ssohrab Borhanian on testing Fisher Matrix codes (spoiler, it&#8217;s tricky).</li>



<li>William Toscani worked with Giulia Fumagalli on eccentric binary black holes, revisiting the old &#8220;isotropic stays isotropic&#8221; problem in PN dynamics.</li>



<li>Francesca Rattegni worked with Matteo &#8220;Bormio&#8221; Bonetti on how the Galaxy can cause Kozai-Lidov oscillations on wide binaries.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>

<p>All right I think this is great (but it took me a long time to convince myself and the others that&#8217;s the case!) In gravitational-wave astronomy we measure binaries, that is, pairs of two objects. Our signals have information about the pair as a whole. At the same time, we care very much about separating those two objects and measuring the properties of individual black holes and neutron stars. We always do that operation without thinking twice, just say that for each posterior sample object &#8220;1&#8221; is that with the larger mass and object &#8220;2&#8221; is that with the lower mass. But is that ok? Surely it&#8217;s a choice, but is it the best one? What does it even mean to pick the &#8220;best&#8221; labels? I think machine learning can help us here and that this problem can be framed using the language of semi-supervised clustering. The results? Well, they seem very significant. Measurements of the black-hole spins are more accurate, you can tell more easily if that&#8217;s a black hole or a neutron star, and overall the posterior distributions just look nicer (go away nasty multimodalities and non-Gaussianities!). </p>

<p>The ringdown is the final bit of a gravitational-wave signal, after the two black holes have merged. It&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s clean; GR is so powerful that all that comes out after a black hole merger has specific frequencies, the fantastic &#8220;quasi-normal modes.&#8221;  While the frequencies only depend on that final BH (thanks Kerr!), the excitations of those frequencies depend on all that happened before, i.e. the merger process itself. In this summer paper by Costantino and the rest of us, we present a new accurate approximant to those amplitudes. Now go home and test GR.</p>

<p>Daria Gangardt has just defended her PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham. The thesis is called <em>&#8220;Black-hole dynamics and their environments&#8221;</em> and jumps from black-hole spins all the way to AGN discs. Daria, it has been a true pleasure working with you, all the way since your very first summer project and through your supervisor changing countries. I&#8217;m both honored and proud that you completed your PhD with me, all the best with everything. Time for drinks now! Go Dr. Daria! </p>

<p>The workshop “<em>Challenges and future perspectives in gravitational-wave astronomy: O4 and beyond</em>” will take place at the Lorentz Center (Leiden, Netherlands) from October 14th to October 18th, 2024.</p>



<p>Our goal is to foster an interdisciplinary discussion (with astrophysicists, data analysts, and machine learners) about how current and future observations of gravitational and electromagnetic waves can be used to shed light on the physics of compact-object formation and evolution.</p>



<p>We encourage interested participants to apply by July 21st, 2024 at:<br><a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html</a></p>



<p>Lorentz Workshops@Oort are scientific meetings for small groups of up to 55 participants, including both senior and junior scientists. We will dedicate a considerable amount of time to discussion sessions, thus stimulating an interactive atmosphere and encouraging collaboration between participants. The venue Lorentz Center@Oort is located at the Faculty of Science campus of Leiden University, the Netherlands. The Lorentz Center provides each participant with office space as well as various practical services such as arranging accommodations at the nearby hotel Van der Valk Hotel Leiden/Tulip Inn Leiden at a special rate, visa assistance, and bike rental. For more information see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lorentzcenter.nl</a></p>



<p><strong>SOC</strong>: Fabio Antonini (chair), Maya Fishbach, Davide Gerosa, Laura Nuttall, Rosalba Perna, Simon Portegies Zwart.</p>
