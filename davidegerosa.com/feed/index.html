<p>New paper from a new student! Here is Matteo Boschini&#8217;s first piece of work, where we look at predictions for the final mass and spins of black-hole remnants. That is, after two black hole merge, what&#8217;s the mass and spin of the guy they left behind? These predictions are typically done by fitting (in various ways) outputs from numerical-relativity simulations but those, unfortunately, can only handle black holes of similar masses. On the other hand, black holes with masses that are very different from each other can be handled analytically. Here we show how to put the two together with a single machine-learning fit. </p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>All right, this is kind of far from my day-to-day topics but working on this paper with Alice and Riccardo was super fun. Think LISA and supermassive binary black holes. And&#8230; the detector does what it wants. That&#8217;s not true of course because the experimentalists are amazing, but there will be noise transients: unexpected blips when the gravitational-wave signal will be corrupted. Here we look at what would happen in a realistic setting when a LISA glitch happens on top of a gravitational wave from a supermassive black hole. </p>

<p>We do population analysis in gravitational waves all the time now. That is: we compare many observations from GW experiments against many simulated datapoints from simulations. But what if you only have one observation? That could be a LIGO guy that is kind of an outlier (think GW190521) or maybe a datapoint from a future detector (think LISA) that feels lonely in his parameter space. Don&#8217;t look further, this is stats for you (and Matt&#8217;s last paper as a grad student&#8230;)</p>

<p>This paper is episode four in the up-down instability series. We first figured out the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">episode 1</a>), then computed when binaries go after the instability (i.e. the endpoint, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">episode 2</a>), and also checked binaries are really unstable in numerical relativity (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/12/15/up-down-instability-of-binary-black-holes-in-numerical-relativity/" data-type="post" data-id="3755">episode 3</a>). Now we look at the inference problem with LIGO/Virgo: if unstable up-down binaries enter the sensitivity window of the detector, will we be able to tell? We phrased the problem with some fancy stats using the so-called Savage Dickey density ratio, which is the right tool to answer this question. As is too often the case, current data are not informative enough but the future is bright and loud.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>
