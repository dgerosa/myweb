										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gravitational-wave population people talk all the time about parametric vs non-parametric methods. Parametric methods mean imposing our astrophysical knowledge on how we look at GW data. This is great, we do want to extract astrophysical knowledge, but what if we don&#8217;t know what to look for? The statisticians tell us to go non-parametric, which means using a flexible model that can fit whatever you want. That&#8217;s great, but what do we learn then? In other words, where&#8217;s the boundary between flexibility and interpretability? Today&#8217;s paper shows that one can conceptually separate these two processes and extract parametric results from non-parametric fits. I&#8217;m very proud of this piece of work, which was <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/20/cecilia-et-al/" data-type="post" data-id="6143">Cecilia Fabbri</a>&#8216;s MSc thesis project and was actually kickstarted by one of my previous students, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/10/28/2-msc-2-bsc/" data-type="post" data-id="5623">Alessandro Santini</a>. We even wrote <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">a poem</a> about this!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so so proud to see my PhD student Viola De Renzis defending her PhD thesis today. Viola&#8217;s thesis is titled <em>&#8220;Gravitational-wave astronomy at the crossroads: from current to future detectors, from single events to populations&#8221;</em> and was examined by Maya Fishbach (Toronto), Laura Sberna (Nottingham) as external referees, as well as Walter Del Pozzo (Pisa), Stephen Green (Nottingham) and Alberto Sesana (Milano-Bicocca) as defense committee members. What should I say, from the first &#8220;off you go and learn Bilby&#8221; meeting we had, to all those discussions at the board, learning how to ski, those codes that did (not) work, and that distinctive laughter across the corridor. Our group will not be the same without Viola. You turned into a great scientist: now &#8220;spacca tutti&#8221; in Marseille!</p>

<p>Together with Ilya Mandel, last week I organized a workshop titled <em>&#8220;Gravitational-wave snowballs, populations, and models&#8221;</em> in Sexten (Italy). Both the science and the scenery were just stellar! We had almost zero talks, and the entire conference was made of brainstorming sessions on three topics &#8220;Parametrization&#8221;, &#8220;Correlation,&#8221; and &#8220;Falsification.&#8221; There are already several emails circulating with several paper ideas coming out of it. Huge thanks to all those who led and participated in the discussions. Here is the conference website&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; and here is us! We should definitely do it again. And remember: if you run population synthesis once, you shall be cursed forever.</p>

<p>In 2024&#8230;. We welcomed Tristan, Chiara, Caroline, Rodrigo, Alex, Federico, and Zachos (group accretion at the Eddington limit). Michele started a faculty in Marseille, Daria graduated, Viola almost graduated and is fighting the paperwork in Marseille, Giulia went to Cambridge, Alice went to the AEI, Cecilia went to Nottingham, Costantino went to Novara. Ringdowns, EMRIs, stochastic backgrounds, p_det, catastrophes, SBI, and 3G detectors don&#8217;t have secrets for us. I think 13 BSc and 3 MSc students defended their projects with us, not sure. Arianna and Nick are two Giovani Talenti, Alex is a Young Researcher. We went to the lake together, got risotto together, and organized a conference named after Inter&#8217;s striker. If you don&#8217;t know what to eat for dinner, define a likelihood and sample it (Loutrel et al. 2024). Or put pins on google maps (Borhanian et al. 2024). You look at data, I look at the physics (Bruel et al. 2024). <br></p>

<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>

<p>Our &#8220;popfisher&#8221; paper is finally out! (and now Viola can submit her PhD thesis). This is about next-generation (aka 3G) gravitational wave detectors. Those beasts will measure millions of black holes&#8230; and with so many of them who cares about each source individually. The important thing will be the population of objects, i.e. how those black holes are distributed as a whole. Measuring populations is an interesting but convoluted statistical problem. Here we implement a quick shortcut (the Fisher matrix) and show that yes, 3G detectors will be amazing&#8230; but more amazing for some things than for others.</p>

<p>Four BSc students and one MSc student defended their research project with us this month. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, huge congrats to Federica Tettoni who got her MSc degree in astrophysics. She worked with Viola De Renzis and myself on labeling black holes in gravitational wave events. Such a fun problem (and we got confused so many times!), more <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/13/which-is-which-identification-of-the-two-compact-objects-in-gravitational-wave-binaries/" data-type="post" data-id="6130">here</a>.</li>



<li>Rocco Giugni (BSc) worked with Matteo Boschini on finding issues in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/07/10/extending-black-hole-remnant-surrogate-models-to-extreme-mass-ratios/" data-type="post" data-id="5426">his remnant surrogate models</a>&#8230;</li>



<li>Giulia Foroni (BSc) worked with me on black-hole binary spin precession. The good old problem of the spin morphologies, but this time looking for two transitions at the same time.</li>



<li>Matilde Vergani (BSc) also worked with me; we looked at merger trees and their combinatorics problem (her presentation pictures of trees, I mean actual trees&#8230;).</li>



<li>Laura Tassoni (BSc) worked with Costantino Pacilio on ringdown data analysis. </li>
</ul>



<p>Thanks all for spending some time in our research group!</p>
