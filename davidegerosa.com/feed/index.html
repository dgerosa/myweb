<p>The quest of finding their astrophysical origin of merging black-hole binaries is now a key open problem in modern astrophysics. Stars are the natural progenitor of black holes: at the end of their lives, the core collapses and leaves behind a compact object. But once those &#8220;first-generation&#8221; black holes are around, they can potentially meet again and form &#8220;second generation&#8221; LIGO events. I first got interested in this problem in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2017/03/18/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers/" data-type="post" data-id="2128">2017</a> and, together with many many others researchers in the community,  we explored the consequences of this &#8220;hierarchical merger&#8221; scenario in terms of both gravitational-wave physics and astrophysical environments. In this Nature Astronomy review article, Maya and I tried to condense all this body of work into a few pages. The result is (we hope) a broad and informed overview of this emerging research strand, with a whopping number of more than 270 citations! Hope you like it.</p>

<p>Hierarchical mergers are the new black. LIGO is seeing black holes that are just too big to be there. The reason is that stars, which collapse and produce black holes, do some funny things when they get too massive. Notably, they start to spontaneously produce positrons and electrons instead of keeping their own photons. Long story short: those missing photons make the temperature go up, ignite an explosion that disrupts the core and prevents black-hole formation. This &#8220;mass gap&#8221; is a solid prediction from our astrophysics friends. In some previous papers, we and other groups pointed out that one can bypass stars and form black holes from previous black holes (and goodbye my dear maximum mass limit!). But now our astrophysics friends are telling us they can also evade the limit with some more elaborate astro-magic (winds, rotation, dredge-up, reaction rates, accretion). Today&#8217;s paper is about telling the two apart, with a key prediction: a black hole with large mass but low spin would raise a glass to the astro-wizards.</p>

<p>General Relativity works well. But we still want to test it, and I guess that’s because it actually works too well (you know, all those quantum things that don’t really fit, etc). And we want to test it with gravitational-wave data, and not just because it’s the new cool thing to do (though it is!) but also because they gravitational waves give us insight into the strong-field regime of gravity where new things, if they are there at all, should show up. Now, all of this sounds great but, in practice, one has to deal with the actual model used to analyze the data. Errors in these signal models (aka waveforms), which are somewhat inevitable, can trick us into thinking we have seen a deviation from General Relativity. So, before you go out on the street and shout that Einstein was wrong, keep calm and mind your waveform.</p>

<p>This is a quick update some of our group activities&#8230; In the past few months we&#8217;ve been busy learning about the formation of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in the disks of active galactic nuclei. We organized a journal club and studied one paper each week on this &#8220;new&#8221; formation channel for LIGO sources. We discussed a ton of topics, going from disk accretion to migration traps, LIGO rates, AGN variability, GW counterparts, hierarchical mergers, all the way to EMRIs.  </p>

<p>Here is the latest in our (by now long) series of papers on black-hole binaries spin precession. This work was is championed by two outstanding PhD students, Daria (in my <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>) and Nate (UT Dallas). The key idea behind this paper is that, for black-hole spins, one cannot really talk about precession without talking about nutation (although we only say &#8220;precession&#8221; all the time&#8230;). The spin of, say, the Earth also does both precession (azimuthal motion) and nutation (polar motion). But, unlike in the Earth problem, for black-hole spins the two motions happen on roughly the same timescale meaning that you cannot really take them apart. Or can you? We stress the role of five parameters that characterize the combined phenomenology of precession and nutation. The hope is now to use them as building blocks for future waveforms&#8230; stay tuned!  </p>

<p>ps. Stupid autocorrect! It&#8217;s nutation, not mutation.</p>

<p>Orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave observations has been long neglected. And with good reasons! Gravitation-wave emission tends to circularize sources. By the time black holes are detectable by LIGO/Virgo/LISA/whatever, they should have had ample time to become circular. Unless something exciting goes on in their formation, things like clusters, triples, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, etc. And if that happens, we want to see it! This paper contains the first model for gravitational waveforms and black-hole remnants (final mass, spin) trained directly on eccentric numerical relativity simulations. Because eccentric is the new circular.</p>

[Intro music&#8230;Now imagine one of those voices from a TV show trailer&#8230;] </p>



<p><strong>Up-down instability S01-E03.</strong><br><em>&#8220;Previously on the up-down instability. After finding out that the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">S01-E01</a>) and calculating its analytic endpoint (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">S01-E02</a>), one terrifying prospect remains. What if it&#8217;s just PN?  Can all of this disappear in the strong-field regime? This challenge now needs to be faced&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>Today&#8217;s paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian<em> (</em>read<em>: approximate</em>)<em> </em>treatment but we couldn&#8217;t be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.black-holes.org/" target="_blank">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read<em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer is&#8230; yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done. </p>

<p>Spin precession is cool, and we want to measure it. In General Relativity, the orbital plane of a binary is not fixed but moves around. This effect is related to the spin of the orbiting black holes and contains a ton of astrophysical information. The question we try to address in this paper is the following: how does one quantify &#8220;how much&#8221; precession a system has? This is typically done by condensing information into a parameter called \(\chi_{\rm p}\), which is here generalize to include two- spin effects. There are two black holes in a binary and we received numerous complaints from the secondaries: they want to join the gravitational-wave fun!</p>
