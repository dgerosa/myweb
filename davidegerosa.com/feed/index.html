<p>We&#8217;re at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore) today, for a brainstorming workshop we organized together with the gravity groups at JHU and Penn State. A ton of interesting people, cool science, fun numerics, big black holes, future detectors, and many new exciting projects we all want to start. The idea is to get &#8220;a little help from my (gravity) friends&#8221;. Have a look at what we&#8217;re up to:  <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-workshop/">davidegerosa.com/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-workshop/</a></p>

<p>Observing gravitational waves from the ground (i.e. LIGO, Virgo, etc) give us a unique view on &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9208005" target="_blank">the last three minutes</a>&#8221; of the life of compact objects before they merge with each other. Going to space (I&#8217;m talking to you, LISA!) will instead give us &#8220;the last three years&#8221;. Completed together with the rest of the Birmingham crowd, this paper provides a realistic view of this truly amazing landscape. LISA observations at low frequencies in the 2030s will be paired with high-frequency data from LIGO&#8217;s successors (the so-called 3rd generation detectors). Together (and that&#8217;s crucial, together!) LISA and 3g detectors will tell us the full story of the life of merging black holes. LIGO alone is like catching up with a movie because you were late at the theatre, LISA alone is like a huge cliffhanger before the series finale&#8230; multiband observations are a bingewatching experience!</p>

<p>Daria&#8217;s new paper is out! (With key contributions from others in the <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>&#8230; This is also Viola&#8217;s first paper!). </p>



<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guys&#8230; our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but we&#8217;re interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism." target="_blank">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called &#8220;sequential prior conditioning&#8221; (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian stats&#8230;). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow. </p>

<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>

<p>I just had the first lectures of a class I&#8217;m teaching for the first time: Astrostatistics and Machine Learning (sounds exciting? Well, it is!). This is an advanced course for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/en/teaching/degree-courses/master-astrophysics-and-space-physics" target="_blank">MSc degree in Astrophysics and Space Science</a> at the University of Milano-Bicocca. My students and I will travel across data inference, Bayesian wonders, sampling, regression, classification, and become best friends with deep learning. All of this is applied to astrophysical datasets.</p>



<p>The entire class is available under the form of jupyter notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022">github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022</a>. The repository is hooked up with the <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022/HEAD">mybinder</a> service. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Spinning black holes are weird (well, all black holes are weird but those that spin are the worse!). They have a funny thing called ergoregion where orbiting particles can have negative energy. Penrose was the first to realize that this can be exploited to extract energy from the black hole itself. The thing is, even if you figure out how to do it, you&#8217;re inevitably going to spin the black hole down. At the end of the day, you&#8217;re left with a fossil black hole that does not have any spin. The mass of that leftover black hole (&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s for lunch dear? Fancy some sushi or prefer a black hole?&#8221;</em>) is called irreducible mass. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Hawking</a> (another giant!) figured out this has to do with thermodynamics. </p>



<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" target="_blank">Weber</a>&#8216;s claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGO&#8217;s black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their &#8220;irreversibility&#8221;, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>
