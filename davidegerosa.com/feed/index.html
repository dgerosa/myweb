<p>All right I think this is great (but it took me a long time to convince myself and the others that&#8217;s the case!) In gravitational-wave astronomy we measure binaries, that is, pairs of two objects. Our signals have information about the pair as a whole. At the same time, we care very much about separating those two objects and measuring the properties of individual black holes and neutron stars. We always do that operation without thinking twice, just say that for each posterior sample object &#8220;1&#8221; is that with the larger mass and object &#8220;2&#8221; is that with the lower mass. But is that ok? Surely it&#8217;s a choice, but is it the best one? What does it even mean to pick the &#8220;best&#8221; labels? I think machine learning can help us here and that this problem can be framed using the language of semi-supervised clustering. The results? Well, they seem very significant. Measurements of the black-hole spins are more accurate, you can tell more easily if that&#8217;s a black hole or a neutron star, and overall the posterior distributions just look nicer (go away nasty multimodalities and non-Gaussianities!). </p>

<p>The ringdown is the final bit of a gravitational-wave signal, after the two black holes have merged. It&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s clean; GR is so powerful that all that comes out after a black hole merger has specific frequencies, the fantastic &#8220;quasi-normal modes.&#8221;  While the frequencies only depend on that final BH (thanks Kerr!), the excitations of those frequencies depend on all that happened before, i.e. the merger process itself. In this summer paper by Costantino and the rest of us, we present a new accurate approximant to those amplitudes. Now go home and test GR.</p>

<p>Daria Gangardt has just defended her PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham. The thesis is called <em>&#8220;Black-hole dynamics and their environments&#8221;</em> and jumps from black-hole spins all the way to AGN discs. Daria, it has been a true pleasure working with you, all the way since your very first summer project and through your supervisor changing countries. I&#8217;m both honored and proud that you completed your PhD with me, all the best with everything. Time for drinks now! Go Dr. Daria! </p>

<p>The workshop “<em>Challenges and future perspectives in gravitational-wave astronomy: O4 and beyond</em>” will take place at the Lorentz Center (Leiden, Netherlands) from October 14th to October 18th, 2024.</p>



<p>Our goal is to foster an interdisciplinary discussion (with astrophysicists, data analysts, and machine learners) about how current and future observations of gravitational and electromagnetic waves can be used to shed light on the physics of compact-object formation and evolution.</p>



<p>We encourage interested participants to apply by July 21st, 2024 at:<br><a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html</a></p>



<p>Lorentz Workshops@Oort are scientific meetings for small groups of up to 55 participants, including both senior and junior scientists. We will dedicate a considerable amount of time to discussion sessions, thus stimulating an interactive atmosphere and encouraging collaboration between participants. The venue Lorentz Center@Oort is located at the Faculty of Science campus of Leiden University, the Netherlands. The Lorentz Center provides each participant with office space as well as various practical services such as arranging accommodations at the nearby hotel Van der Valk Hotel Leiden/Tulip Inn Leiden at a special rate, visa assistance, and bike rental. For more information see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lorentzcenter.nl</a></p>



<p><strong>SOC</strong>: Fabio Antonini (chair), Maya Fishbach, Davide Gerosa, Laura Nuttall, Rosalba Perna, Simon Portegies Zwart.</p>

<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>We are organizing &#8220;Gravitational-wave&nbsp;snowballs, populations, and models&#8221; — a workshop to be held in Sexten, in the Dolomites region of Italy, January 20-24, 2025:<br><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs</a></p>



<p>Our goal is to bring together researchers at the forefront of both forward astrophysical modeling of compact object binary formation and gravitational-wave data analysis in preparation for the upcoming O4 data release of LIGO/Virgo, for discussions focused on population-level modeling and inference.</p>



<p>The meeting will be held at Bad Moos Hotel right next to the ski slopes and the conference program will have appropriate breaks for snow activities; more details are available at<br><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs/logistics" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs/logistics</a></p>



<p>We hope you will consider applying to participate. Space is limited to 40 people. Please apply online at<br><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs/registration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs/registration</a><br>by July 15, 2024.&nbsp; We plan to notify accepted participants by the end of July.</p>

<p>&#8230; and we&#8217;re <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/07/15/gravitational-wave-selection-effects-using-neural-network-classifiers/" data-type="post" data-id="3542">back to</a> selection effects. That means modeling what you cannot see. The black holes that gravitational-wave detectors observe are not representative of those that are out there in the Universe. Some are easier to see, some are harder. Quantifying how much easier and harder is crucial to properly understand the underlying astrophysics. In this paper (which came <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/09/20/students-going-for-3g-ringdowns-and-selection-effects/" data-type="post" data-id="5605">out of a BSc student project</a>!), we go back to the basics and work out gravitational-wave selection effects one step after the other, using and refining the most common approximation. Two things to remember: including noise fluctuations is easy, and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 11 is probably ok. </p>
