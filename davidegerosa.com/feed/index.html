<p>We&#8217;re back to predicting the excitation amplitude of black hole merger ringdowns. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/08/09/postmerger-a-flexible-mapping-of-ringdown-amplitudes-for-non-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="6125">We already looked</a> into the simpler case of binaries with aligned spins, and now tried to study the full problem of binaries with misaligned (i.e. processing) spins. Well, this is a hard problem! It&#8217;s not even clear which mode is the stronger one anymore, and finding suitable coordinates is not at all trivial. While this is just a first exploration, there&#8217;s so much interesting phenomenology here! Do it yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/cpacilio/postmerger">postmerger</a> package.</p>

<p>The 2017 paper&nbsp;&#8220;<strong>Are merging black holes born from stellar collapse or previous mergers?</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;that I wrote with<a href="https://pages.jh.edu/eberti2/posts/2025-frontiers-of-science-award/"> Emanuele Berti</a> was selected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icbs.cn">2025 Frontiers of Science Award</a>. These prizes are awarded by the International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS), sponsored by the City of Beijing and the Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Application (BIMSA). Every year, they select influential recent papers in Physics, Maths, and Computer Science. </p>



<p>The complete list of Physics papers selected for awards is available&nbsp;<a href="http://davidegerosa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025FSA_Physics.pdf">here</a>. Ours is one of only three papers that were selected in the category&nbsp;<em>Astrophysics and Cosmology &#8211; Theory</em>. We&#8217;ll collect the award in July at the Great Hall of the People of China in Beijing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy to see how a seemingly simple idea we had (<em>&#8220;What if LIGO&#8217;s black holes merge multiple times?&#8221;</em>) went so far! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2017/03/18/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers/" data-type="post" data-id="2128">Our paper</a>&nbsp;was published in Physical Review D in 2017, selected as an&nbsp;<em>Editor’s Suggestion</em> back then&#8230; and now got an award!</p>

<p>Great paper led by <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/03/23/three-more/" data-type="post" data-id="5876">our former MSc student</a> Alessandro today! This is about combining the distributions of gravitational waves and galaxies to do cosmology. These two probes measure different things (distance and redshift, respectively), so their distributions will &#8220;match&#8221; only if the cosmological model is right. You can actually use this to <em>measure</em> the cosmological model itself. Short answer: putting together 3G detectors and Euclid is a great idea. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational-wave physics, our 2025 call for PhD scholarships is now available. The procedure is described here (Session 1):</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.  </p>



<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>&#8220;Guide to filling in the online application.&#8221;</em> There&#8217;s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you&#8217;re interested in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3. </p>



<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you&#8217;ve done already. Hope this helps!</p>



<p>For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me: <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>The Italian Society of General Relativity and Gravitation (SIGRAV) announces the 26th SIGRAV Conference, hosted by the University of Milano-Bicocca, to be held in Milan, Italy, from September 8-12, 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025</a></p>



<p>The conference will cover various aspects of classical and quantum gravity, including tests of General Relativity, cosmology, gravity experiments, and gravitational waves from experimental, theoretical, and data-analysis perspectives.</p>



<p>Participation is open to SIGRAV members and non-members alike, both nationally and internationally. The program will feature a series of broad review talks on various aspects of gravitational physics, as well as contributed talks. The SIGRAV Amaldi medals, the SIGRAV prizes for young researchers, and the Giulio Rampa PhD thesis prize will be awarded during the conference. There will also be a public event dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914.</p>



<p>Abstracts for contributed talks should submitted by May 31, 2025. We aim to announce the full conference program by the end of June. Registrations will be accepted until July 15, 2025.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; you can also explore nearby lakes or venture into the stunning Alps.</p>

<p>When inferring black holes from gravitational-wave data, we tend to do two things, one after the other. First, we consider each event individually and measure its parameters (masses, spins, etc). Then we consider all the events together and measure the population properties. This is what we do all the time, but, actually, if objects are now part of a population, those parameters should be looked at again in light of all the others. This full problem (all parameters of all the events plus the population parameters) is daunting, and <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2021/08/06/population-informed-priors-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy/" data-type="post" data-id="4498">in the past</a> we used an indirect and somewhat convoluted approach. We got back to it now, and this time, we managed to do it head-on. Let me introduce this giant 500-dimensional sampling of the full population problem! </p>

<p>Long gravitational-wave signals are, well, long. And long often means painful, as more data need to be stored and processed. Kind of intuitively, the solution might be that of cutting things into chunks, so that long becomes short. Here we apply this idea to the popular inner product entering all gravitational-wave pipelines; this is a key building block of everything we do. The answer is that using SFTs, &#8220;Short-time Fourier Transforms&#8221;, can make things faster by more than 3 orders of magnitudes, sometimes 5. We think this is <em>the</em> solution to future gravitational-wave data analysis problems (think LISA and 3G&#8230;).</p>
