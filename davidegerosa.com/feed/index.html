<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>



<p>Some pictures now&#8230; </p>

<p>We do population analysis in gravitational waves all the time now. That is: we compare many observations from GW experiments against many simulated datapoints from simulations. But what if you only have one observation? That could be a LIGO guy that is kind of an outlier (think GW190521) or maybe a datapoint from a future detector (think LISA) that feels lonely in his parameter space. Don&#8217;t look further, this is stats for you (and Matt&#8217;s last paper as a grad student&#8230;)</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got the best name ever for a numerical code! Let me introduce QLUSTER which, guess what, simulates clusters. We finally put out a piece of code that was originally <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2019/06/14/escape-speed-of-stellar-clusters-from-multiple-generation-black-hole-mergers-in-the-upper-mass-gap/" data-type="post" data-id="2604">developed in 2019</a> and later used in several papers.  It&#8217;s a very very simple treatment of black-hole binary formation in dense stellar environments, with the goal of predicting gravitational waves from repeated mergers. The code is available at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mdmould/qluster" target="_blank">github.com/mdmould/qluster</a> and a short description is provided in the proceedings of the 2023 edition of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2023/Gravitation/" target="_blank">amazing Moriond conference</a>.</p>

<p>This paper is episode four in the up-down instability series. We first figured out the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">episode 1</a>), then computed when binaries go after the instability (i.e. the endpoint, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">episode 2</a>), and also checked binaries are really unstable in numerical relativity (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/12/15/up-down-instability-of-binary-black-holes-in-numerical-relativity/" data-type="post" data-id="3755">episode 3</a>). Now we look at the inference problem with LIGO/Virgo: if unstable up-down binaries enter the sensitivity window of the detector, will we be able to tell? We phrased the problem with some fancy stats using the so-called Savage Dickey density ratio, which is the right tool to answer this question. As is too often the case, current data are not informative enough but the future is bright and loud.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. The application deadline is April 19th, 2023 for positions starting in the Fall of 2023:</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. Candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well.</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of &#8220;open&#8221; scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, our group this year is advertising an additional &#8220;project&#8221; scholarship titled &#8220;Gravitational-wave source modeling&#8221; and supervised by Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this additional opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.3).</p>



<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at <a href="https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">astro.fisica.unimib.it</a>. For informal inquiries and expressions of interest please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated. </p>



<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>
