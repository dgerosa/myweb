<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>

My students and I will travel across data inference, Bayesian wonders, sampling, regression, classification, and become best friends with deep learning. All of this is applied to astrophysical datasets.</p>



<p>The entire class is available under the form of jupyter notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022">github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Spinning black holes are weird (well, all black holes are weird but those that spin are the worse!). They have a funny thing called ergoregion where orbiting particles can have negative energy. Penrose was the first to realize that this can be exploited to extract energy from the black hole itself. The thing is, even if you figure out how to do it, you&#8217;re inevitably going to spin the black hole down. At the end of the day, you&#8217;re left with a fossil black hole that does not have any spin. The mass of that leftover black hole (&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s for lunch dear? Fancy some sushi or prefer a black hole?&#8221;</em>) is called irreducible mass. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Hawking</a> (another giant!) figured out this has to do with thermodynamics. </p>



<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" target="_blank">Weber</a>&#8216;s claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGO&#8217;s black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their &#8220;irreversibility&#8221;, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>

We kept on finding configurations that our implementation could not handle&#8230; And now we know this is real! Finding disk solutions when the spin of the black hole has a large misalignment is just not possible! And that&#8217;s because the disk really breaks into different sections. We&#8217;ve now checked it with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical numerical simulations that not only confirm what we suspected but also show some funny things (like breaking being prevented by disk spirals, etc). I was serious, breaking things is real fun!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Great Scott, a new paper! When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together. The issue Matt and I are tackling here is that one needs to be consistent with putting together different events when fitting the entire population. This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here). In that case, it&#8217;s dangerous to put together events taken at different stages of their evolution. And the solution to this problem is&#8230;. time travel! We show that but propagating binaries backward in time, one can put all sources on the same footing. After that, estimating the impact of the detector requires traveling forward in time, so going &#8220;back to the future&#8221;. After all, we all know that post-Newtonian black-hole binary integrations look like this:</p>
