<p>Here is the latest in our (by now long) series of papers on black-hole binaries spin precession. This work was is championed by two outstanding PhD students, Daria (in my <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>) and Nate (UT Dallas). The key idea behind this paper is that, for black-hole spins, one cannot really talk about precession without talking about nutation (although we only say &#8220;precession&#8221; all the time&#8230;). The spin of, say, the Earth also does both precession (azimuthal motion) and nutation (polar motion). But, unlike in the Earth problem, for black-hole spins the two motions happen on roughly the same timescale meaning that you cannot really take them apart. Or can you? We stress the role of five parameters that characterize the combined phenomenology of precession and nutation. The hope is now to use them as building blocks for future waveforms&#8230; stay tuned!  </p>

<p>ps. Stupid autocorrect! It&#8217;s nutation, not mutation.</p>

<p>Orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave observations has been long neglected. And with good reasons! Gravitation-wave emission tends to circularize sources. By the time black holes are detectable by LIGO/Virgo/LISA/whatever, they should have had ample time to become circular. Unless something exciting goes on in their formation, things like clusters, triples, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, etc. And if that happens, we want to see it! This paper contains the first model for gravitational waveforms and black-hole remnants (final mass, spin) trained directly on eccentric numerical relativity simulations. Because eccentric is the new circular.</p>

[Intro music&#8230;Now imagine one of those voices from a TV show trailer&#8230;] </p>



<p><strong>Up-down instability S01-E03.</strong><br><em>&#8220;Previously on the up-down instability. After finding out that the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">S01-E01</a>) and calculating its analytic endpoint (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">S01-E02</a>), one terrifying prospect remains. What if it&#8217;s just PN?  Can all of this disappear in the strong-field regime? This challenge now needs to be faced&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>Today&#8217;s paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian<em> (</em>read<em>: approximate</em>)<em> </em>treatment but we couldn&#8217;t be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.black-holes.org/" target="_blank">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read<em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer is&#8230; yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done. </p>

<p>Spin precession is cool, and we want to measure it. In General Relativity, the orbital plane of a binary is not fixed but moves around. This effect is related to the spin of the orbiting black holes and contains a ton of astrophysical information. The question we try to address in this paper is the following: how does one quantify &#8220;how much&#8221; precession a system has? This is typically done by condensing information into a parameter called \(\chi_{\rm p}\), which is here generalize to include two- spin effects. There are two black holes in a binary and we received numerous complaints from the secondaries: they want to join the gravitational-wave fun!</p>

<p>If you want to know what&#8217;s out there, you need to figure out what&#8217;s missing. And gravitational-wave astronomy is no exception. We are trying to infer how things like black holes and neutron stars behave in the Universe given a limited number of observations, which are somehow selected by our detectors. This is a very general problem which is common to a variety of fields of science. We provide a hopefully pedagogical introduction to population inference, deriving all the necessary statistics from the ground up. In other terms, here is what you always wanted to know about this population business everyone is talking about but never dared to ask.   </p>



<p>This document is going to be part of a truly massive &#8220;Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy&#8221; soon to be published by Springer (not really a handbook I would say, you probably need a truck to carry it around).</p>
