<p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em>&#8230; Call me an ambulance.</p>



<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because it&#8217;s not centered on the galaxy (it&#8217;s a bit off) and it&#8217;s also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered it&#8217;s all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found that&#8230; mmh, well, it&#8217;s a maybe.  </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>



<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>



<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (“professore associato” in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>



<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>



<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>

<p>Hey Chris, just wanted to say thanks because you wanted to understand what was going on, for that ski run down the Highland Bowl in Aspen, for sending me yet another version of those StarTrack files I had to postprocess, for those obscure code comments in Polish, for that last chat in Japan last month (I&#8217;ll finish that calculation about tides we sketched at the board!), and for the energy. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re on a beautiful mountain.</p>

<p>Much like Spotify, here is our group &#8220;Wrapped&#8221;, 2023 edition!</p>



<p>Some of the group highlights include&#8230;  We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davide&#8217;s ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>



<p>&#8230; now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>
