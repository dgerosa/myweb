Stars are the natural progenitor of black holes: at the end of their lives, the core collapses and leaves behind a compact object. But once those &#8220;first-generation&#8221; black holes are around, they can potentially meet again and form &#8220;second generation&#8221; LIGO events. I first got interested in this problem in <a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/2017\/03\/18\/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2128\">2017<\/a> and, together with many many others researchers in the community,  we explored the consequences of this &#8220;hierarchical merger&#8221; scenario in terms of both gravitational-wave physics and astrophysical environments. In this Nature Astronomy review article, Maya and I tried to condense all this body of work into a few pages. The result is (we hope) a broad and informed overview of this emerging research strand, with a whopping number of more than 270 citations!
