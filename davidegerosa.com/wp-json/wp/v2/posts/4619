Targeted investigations include applications of machine-learning techniques to gravitational-wave physics, modeling of black-hole binary populations from their stellar progenitors, relativistic dynamics, and statistical inference. Candidates will have ample opportunities to explore other areas of gravitational-wave astronomy and will be encouraged to develop independent collaborations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate awarding two positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The astrophysics group at Milan-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: gravitational-wave astronomy, stellar evolution, relativistic astrophysics, general relativity, machine learning, statistical inference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it\">davide.gerosa@unimib.it<\/a>&nbsp;by December 1st, 2021 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent to the same address by December 1st, 2021. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it\">davide.gerosa@unimib.it<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of Milan-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.
