Curiosity and interest in the LISA space mission brought them to design a full day of talks from leading experts in the field. They put Stefano Vitale, Alessandra Buonanno, and Bernard Schutz in the same room with the (astro)physics students and, well, a few of us who tagged along. The result was an amazing rollercoaster called &#8220;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fisica.unimib.it\/it\/eventi\/lisa-and-beyond\" target=\"_blank\">LISA and beyond<\/a>&#8221; across the wonders of the experimental design by Stefano (is this truly going to work?!?), some amazing order-of-magnitude calculations that Bernard pulled off (wish I could do that!), and a broad vision by Alessandra across the discoveries we had and those we will soon be seeing (can&#8217;t wait, can&#8217;t wait!). Our students engaged with the speakers, asked questions, and organized a round table touching topics like the carbon footprint of space missions, gender equality, and how to manage a research group. Such ingenuity and enthusiasm are what keeps science alive! We should learn from our students and do science like that.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Locandina-ufficiale-LISA-1-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5262\" width=\"446\" height=\"632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Locandina-ufficiale-LISA-1-copy.jpg 595w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Locandina-ufficiale-LISA-1-copy-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The student reps of our department (codename: redshift) have organized a stellar event today.
