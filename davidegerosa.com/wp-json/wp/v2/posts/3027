The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be &#8220;golden&#8221; events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-1024x724.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3952\" width=\"456\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-300x212.jpg 300w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-768x543.jpg 768w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-1536x1086.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PhD_Poster-copy-2048x1448.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re accepting applications from prospective PhD students.
