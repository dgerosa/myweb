I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question &#8220;<em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?<\/em>&#8221; and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise I&#8217;ll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you couldn&#8217;t make it for whatever reason no worries, we&#8217;ll do it again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/DSC_0007_lighter-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/DSC_0007_lighter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/DSC_0007_lighter-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/DSC_0007_lighter-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:86px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.<\/strong> These are our discussion sessions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Intro: the pieces of the population problem.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>What can\/should astrophysicists and pop-synthers predict?<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>What\u00a0is the predictive power of pop-synth codes?
