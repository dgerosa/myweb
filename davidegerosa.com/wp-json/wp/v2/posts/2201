The prize announcement reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Dr. Gerosa\u2019s Ph.D. Thesis on \u201cSource modelling at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy\u201d shows an impressive ability to master a rather broad range of topics in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational wave physics. The research initiated by Dr. Gerosa in these areas has triggered follow-up work, providing new important insights and new physical scenarios. The large impact that the work of Dr. Gerosa has already had can only continue to grow.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was recently awarded the 2018 Giulio Rampa Thesis Prize for Outstanding Research in General Relativity.
