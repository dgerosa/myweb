Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Federico Ravelli.
