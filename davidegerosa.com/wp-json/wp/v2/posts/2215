This year&#8217; edition was organized by me, Leo Stein and a few others, and was dedicated to Jim Isenberg who first started the Pacific Gravity meetings 34 years ago. We had a beautiful blend of people (including some very talented undergrads!) and topics (from numerical relativity, to quantum gravity, high-energy physics and gravitational-wave astronomy). I hope everybody had fun. I surely did!<\/p>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tapir.caltech.edu\/~pcgm34\/Schedule\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conference program<\/a>, and this below is the logo that I designed (It&#8217;s supposed to be Newton&#8217;s apple with some gravitational waves in Caltech&#8217;s orange color; I know, I&#8217;m a scientist, not an artist&#8230;).
