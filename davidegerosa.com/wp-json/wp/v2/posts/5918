Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational-wave physics, covering activities ranging from astrophysical\/numerical modeling to data analysis. The group counts 7 faculty members (Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Sesana, and an upcoming new hire) together with several postdocs (of which two prize fellows) and PhD students. Candidates will also have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our PhD admission program includes several \u201copen\u201d scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default.
