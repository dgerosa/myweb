At the same time, new and more data require appropriately powerful statistical tools to be fully exploited. This highly interactive workshop (fewer talks, more working together!) will be the opportunity to share recent progress, identify what new steps are now needed, and hopefully set the stage for substantial progress in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop will take place on July 10-14, 2023 at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which is located near the city center of Milan, Italy. Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; nearby excursions will take you to the Italian lakes and the stunning Alps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we are unable to provide travel support, the workshop will have no registration fee. The workshop will be in person without remote options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested participants should register on the conference website by March 1st, 2023. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline, so please do not make travel plans until you hear back from us. When registering please indicate which of the discussion session(s) you would like to contribute to. Early career scientists will have the opportunity to give flash talks highlighting their science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davide Gerosa (Milano-Bicocca), Emanuele Berti (Johns Hopkins), Salvatore Vitale (MIT)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"235\" src=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-1024x235.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5220\" srcset=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-1024x235.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-300x69.jpg 300w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-768x177.jpg 768w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-1536x353.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-22.38.20-2048x471.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is a pleasure to announce the workshop \u201cGravitational-wave populations: what\u2019s next?\u201d which we are currently organizing for next summer: https:\/\/sites.google.com\/unimib.it\/gwpopnext As the catalog of detected gravitational-wave events grows from O(10) to O(100) sources (but think millions in a few &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/2023\/01\/12\/gravitational-wave-populations-whats-next\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[8,11],"tags":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","amp_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5219"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5219"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5219\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5223,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5219\/revisions\/5223"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5219"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5219"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5219"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
