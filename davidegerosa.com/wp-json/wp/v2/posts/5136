I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending\/arguing\/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" src=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-1024x769.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5137\" srcset=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-1024x769.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-768x577.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-1536x1154.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG_0012-2048x1539.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Here we are, from left to right: Alessandro (sorry I cut your face in half!), me trying to be funny, Riccardo, and smiling Alice!
