This work was is championed by two outstanding PhD students, Daria (in my <a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/group\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2466\">group<\/a>) and Nate (UT Dallas). The key idea behind this paper is that, for black-hole spins, one cannot really talk about precession without talking about nutation (although we only say &#8220;precession&#8221; all the time&#8230;). The spin of, say, the Earth also does both precession (azimuthal motion) and nutation (polar motion). But, unlike in the Earth problem, for black-hole spins the two motions happen on roughly the same timescale meaning that you cannot really take them apart. Or can you? We stress the role of five parameters that characterize the combined phenomenology of precession and nutation. The hope is now to use them as building blocks for future waveforms&#8230; stay tuned!  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daria Gangardt, Nathan Steinle, Michael Kesden,\u00a0<strong>Davide Gerosa<\/strong>, Evangelos Stoikos.<br>Physical Review D 103 (2021)\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prd\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevD.103.124026\" target=\"_blank\">124026<\/a>.<br>arXiv:<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2103.03894\" target=\"_blank\">2103.03894<\/a>\u00a0[gr-qc].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ps.
