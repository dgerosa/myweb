We could do a lot of cool stuff, in both the astro and the theory side of things. In today&#8217;s paper, we try to figure out how easy or hard it will be to extract these signals from the LISA noise. Well, it&#8217;s hard. In terms of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required, we find that this is as high as 15.
