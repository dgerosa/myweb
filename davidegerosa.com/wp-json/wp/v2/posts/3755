This challenge now needs to be faced&#8221;.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian<em> (<\/em>read<em>: approximate<\/em>)<em> <\/em>treatment but we couldn&#8217;t be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.black-holes.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">SXS<\/a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read<em>: the real deal!<\/em>) code. And the answer is&#8230; yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vijay Varma,\u00a0Matthew Mould,\u00a0<strong>Davide Gerosa<\/strong>,\u00a0Mark A.
