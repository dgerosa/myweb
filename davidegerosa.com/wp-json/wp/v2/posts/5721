With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO\/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (\u201cprofessore associato\u201d in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and\/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation.
