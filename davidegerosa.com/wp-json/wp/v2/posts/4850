This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called &#8220;sequential prior conditioning&#8221; (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian stats&#8230;).
