May 7, 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Main paper for today:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1990ApJ...361..300F\/abstract\">Foster and Backer. &#8220;Constructing a Pulsar Timing Array&#8221; (1990)<\/a>. <br>This is one of the key papers suggesting a dedicated effort to time pulsars with the aim of detecting\u00a0low-frequency\u00a0GWs.<\/li><li>A couple of the earliest (if not the earliest?) papers suggesting pulsar timing as a means to detect GWs:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1979ApJ...234.1100D\/abstract\">Detweiler. &#8220;Pulsar timing measurements and the search for gravitational waves&#8221; (1979)<\/a>.<br><a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1978SvA....22...36S\/abstract\">Sazhin &#8220;Opportunities for detecting ultralong gravitational waves&#8221; (1978)<\/a>.<\/li><li>Early observational upper limits on GWs:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=4164&amp;action=edit#page_6https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1983ApJ...265L..35R\/abstract\">Romani and Taylor. &#8220;An upper limit on the stochastic background of\u00a0ultralow-frequency\u00a0gravitational waves&#8221; (1983)<\/a>.<br><a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1983ApJ...265L..39H\/abstract\">Hellings and Downs. &#8220;Upper limits on the isotropic gravitational radiation background from pulsar timing analysis&#8221; (1983)<\/a>.<\/li><li>See also:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1989BAAS...21.1205F\/abstract\">Foster and Backer. &#8220;Results from the\u00a0Berkeley-NRAO\u00a0Pulsar Timing Array Experiment&#8221; (1989)<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minutes by Chris<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Alberto highlighted the importance of 3 very early papers which are very commonly cited as the origin of the idea for PTAs: it seems Sazhin (1978) was the fi\frst to suggest something along these lines, but it was Detweiler (1979) who got all the details arranged in a way that we would immediately recognize today, and [quite a bit later] it was Foster &amp; Backer (1990) who made the \ffirst attempt to actually construct a PTA.<\/li><li>The basic effect of GWs delaying\/advancing light from some distant object was studied even earlier [Estabrook &amp; Wahlquist 1975], but in the context of Doppler tracking distant spacecraft. In fact, it seems to us that the idea for PTAs owes quite a bit to the older idea of Doppler tracking spacecraft.<\/li><li>An amazing paper: <a href=\"https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1998grwa.conf..272V\/abstract\">Vecchio, Bertotti, and Iess. &#8220;Coalescing Binaries and Doppler Experiments&#8221; (1998)<\/a>.<\/li><li>Moving on to the main paper for this week, we discussed the details of the timing model (eq. 3) and the importance of the time standard (i.e. clocks = monopole) and locating the SSB (i.e ephemeris = dipole).<\/li><li>We also discussed dispersion quite a bit. Including how observations at several frequencies allow you to extrapolate to an ideal &#8220;infinite frequency&#8221; time of arrival.<br>We also discussed (but didn\u2019t reach a conclusion) on why the Earth\u2019s atmosphere doesn\u2019t appear to in uence the time of arrival in the timing model.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Episode 2.
