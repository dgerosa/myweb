Come and join us at the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sr.bham.ac.uk\/gwgroup\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">University of Milano-Bicocca!<\/a>&nbsp; Our science is great but, if that&#8217;s not enough, Milan is a truly beautiful city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I list a few possible opportunities to work with me and my group, ranging from postdocs to Phd and student theses. If you&#8217;re interested in any of these, feel free to drop me a line at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:d.gerosa@bham.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">davide.gerosa@unimib.it<\/a> to discuss the application process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PhD in Milan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational astronomy, then Milan is <strong>the<\/strong> place for you! The deadline is usually in June each year for positions starting in the fall. Here is some <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/en.unimib.it\/education\/doctoral-research-phd-programmes\/how-apply-phd-programme\" target=\"_blank\">general information<\/a>&nbsp;on the program, including funding, etc. Please get in touch with me at any time for tips on the application call. There are positions reserved for candidates from outside Italy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowship<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I actively support applications to the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/research\/mariecurieactions\/node_en\" target=\"_blank\">Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowships<\/a> from the European Union, both their European and Global scheme. I looked after a few of these applications in the past and know the scheme relatively well; our grant office in Milan will also provide tremendous help! If you&#8217;re interested in this program, please get in touch. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Master&#8217;s and Bachelor&#8217;s theses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For students at the University of Milan-Bicocca, we have several thesis projects available, both at the MSc (laurea magistrale) and BSc (laurea triennale) level. Possible topics range from dynamics of black-hole binaries, modeling of gravitational-wave signals, statistical and machine learning applications, etc, covering both theoretical and computational activities. More broadly, I am happy to design a project that works <em>for you,<\/em> based on what you find most exciting in gravitational (astro)physics. For efficient planning, I encourage students to get in touch with me about a month or so in advance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Visiting students<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I welcome externally funded MSc, MSc and PhD students who wish to visit my group for research projects. A few example of funding sources include: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/studyinitaly.esteri.it\/en\/home_borse\">StudyInItaly<\/a> program offers grants that can be used for research projects (and not only to formally enroll in classes here as the website seems to imply). <\/li><li>For European students, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/programmes\/erasmus-plus\/node_en\" target=\"_blank\">Erasmus+<\/a> program provides funding that can be used for research projects.<\/li><li>For students from the US, I encourage you to look into the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phys.ufl.edu\/ireu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravitational Physics International REU<\/a>, where students engage in summer projects across the world, including my group.  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Past positions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the positions I opened in recent years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/2021\/10\/04\/postdoctoral-fellowships-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-at-milan-bicocca-italy\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4619\">2021 postdoc positions in Milan<\/a>.
