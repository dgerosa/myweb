Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I list a few possible opportunities to work with me and my group ranging from postdocs to Phd and student theses. If you&#8217;re interested in any of these, feel free to drop me a line at\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:d.gerosa@bham.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">davide.gerosa@unimib.it<\/a> to discuss the application process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PhD in Milan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational physics, then Milan is <strong>the<\/strong> place for you! The deadline is usually in June each year for positions starting in the fall. Here is some <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/en.unimib.it\/education\/doctoral-research-phd-programmes\/how-apply-phd-programme\" target=\"_blank\">general information<\/a>\u00a0on the program, including funding, etc. Please get in touch with me at any time for tips on the application call. There are positions reserved for candidates from outside Italy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowship<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I actively support applications to the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/research\/mariecurieactions\/node_en\" target=\"_blank\">Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowships<\/a> from the European Union, both the European and the Global scheme. I looked after a few of these applications in the past and know the scheme relatively well; our grant office in Milan will also provide tremendous help! If you&#8217;re interested in this program, please get in touch. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Master&#8217;s and Bachelor&#8217;s theses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For students at the University of Milan-Bicocca, we have several thesis projects available, both at the Master (laurea magistrale) and the Bachelor (laurea triennale) level. Topics range from dynamics of black hole binaries, modeling of gravitational-wave signals, statistical and machine learning applications, etc, covering both theoretical and computational activities. I encourage students to get in touch about a month or so in advance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Visiting students<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I welcome externally funded MSc, MSc and PhD students who wish to tackle projects. A few example of funding sources include: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For European students, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/programmes\/erasmus-plus\/node_en\" target=\"_blank\">Erasmus+<\/a> program provides funding that can be used for research projects.<\/li><li>For students from the US, I encourage you to look into the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phys.ufl.edu\/ireu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravitational Physics International REU<\/a>, where students engage in summer projects across the world, including my group.  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Past positions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the positions I opened in recent years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/davidegerosa.com\/2021\/05\/18\/come-to-milan-for-a-phd\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4287\">2021 PhD positions in Milan<\/a>.
