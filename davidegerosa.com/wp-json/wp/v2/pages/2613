Come and join us at the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sr.bham.ac.uk\/gwgroup\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">University of Milano-Bicocca!<\/a>&nbsp; Our science is great&#8230; and if that&#8217;s not enough, Milan is a truly beautiful city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner, food is outstanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I list a few possible opportunities to work with me and my group. If you&#8217;re interested in any of these, feel free to drop me a line at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:d.gerosa@bham.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">davide.gerosa@unimib.it<\/a> to discuss the application process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PhD in Milan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational astronomy, then Milan is <strong>the<\/strong> place for you! The deadline is usually in May\/June each year for positions starting in the fall. Here is some <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/en.unimib.it\/education\/doctoral-research-phd-programmes\/how-apply-phd-programme\" target=\"_blank\">general information<\/a>&nbsp;on the program, including funding, etc. Please get in touch with me at any time for tips on the application call. There are positions reserved for candidates from outside Italy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowships<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I actively support applications to the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/research\/mariecurieactions\/node_en\" target=\"_blank\">Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie fellowships<\/a> from the European Union, both their European and Global scheme. I supervised several of these applications in the past (including a few winners!) and know the scheme very well. Our grant office in Milan will also provide tremendous help! If you&#8217;re interested in this program, please get in touch. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Master&#8217;s and Bachelor&#8217;s theses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For students at the University of Milan-Bicocca, I have several thesis projects available, both at the MSc (&#8220;laurea magistrale&#8221;) and BSc (&#8220;laurea triennale&#8221;) level. Possible topics range from dynamics of black-hole binaries, modeling of gravitational-wave signals, statistical and machine learning applications, etc, covering both theoretical and computational activities. More broadly, I am happy to design a project that works <em>for you,<\/em> based on what you find most exciting in gravitational (astro)physics. MSc thesis projects are often completed in collaboration with external researchers with students spending some time abroad. For efficient planning, I encourage students to get in touch with me about a month or so in advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Visitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I welcome externally funded students and researchers who wish to visit my group to complete a project together.
