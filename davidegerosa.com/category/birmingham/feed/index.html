<p>Big stars burn everything they have, die fast, and produce big black holes. So when you see two black holes together, it&#8217;s likely that the big black hole comes from the big star. Or maybe not? Before dying, the big star can drop some mass onto the other guy, making it bigger! So now, the initially big star still produces the first black hole, but, at the end of the day, that might not be the more massive black hole anymore! This scenario is called &#8220;mass-ratio reversal&#8221; and our astrophysics friends have put together many models out there showing this is indeed possible for a good fraction of the black holes that produce gravitational-wave events. So here we ask the data: given the events LIGO and Virgo have seen so far, what&#8217;s the evidence for mass-ratio reversal in binary stars? Read Matt&#8217;s paper to find out.</p>

<p>Observing gravitational waves from the ground (i.e. LIGO, Virgo, etc) give us a unique view on &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9208005" target="_blank">the last three minutes</a>&#8221; of the life of compact objects before they merge with each other. Going to space (I&#8217;m talking to you, LISA!) will instead give us &#8220;the last three years&#8221;. Completed together with the rest of the Birmingham crowd, this paper provides a realistic view of this truly amazing landscape. LISA observations at low frequencies in the 2030s will be paired with high-frequency data from LIGO&#8217;s successors (the so-called 3rd generation detectors). Together (and that&#8217;s crucial, together!) LISA and 3g detectors will tell us the full story of the life of merging black holes. LIGO alone is like catching up with a movie because you were late at the theatre, LISA alone is like a huge cliffhanger before the series finale&#8230; multiband observations are a bingewatching experience!</p>

<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>

<p>Great Scott, a new paper! When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together. The issue Matt and I are tackling here is that one needs to be consistent with putting together different events when fitting the entire population. This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here). In that case, it&#8217;s dangerous to put together events taken at different stages of their evolution. And the solution to this problem is&#8230;. time travel! We show that but propagating binaries backward in time, one can put all sources on the same footing. After that, estimating the impact of the detector requires traveling forward in time, so going &#8220;back to the future&#8221;. After all, we all know that post-Newtonian black-hole binary integrations look like this:</p>

<p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka &#8220;parameter estimation&#8221;), all of them together (aka &#8220;population&#8221;), or each of them individually while they&#8217;re together. That&#8217;s what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, don&#8217;t do this at home.</p>

<p>Today we go deep into the perilous world of binary population synthesis! Using Nicola&#8217;s code <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" target="_blank">MOBSE</a>, our master student Maciej has implemented some new prescriptions for how supernovae explode and produce compact objects. In practice, we use the compactness (that&#8217;s mass over radius) of the stellar core before the explosion to decide if that specific star will form a neutron star or a black hole. This now needs to be compared carefully with gravitational-wave data, but we suggest that there are two key signatures one should look for: the lowest black hole masses and the relative merger rates between black holes and neutron stars.  </p>
