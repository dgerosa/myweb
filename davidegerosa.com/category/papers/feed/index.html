<p>This paper is episode four in the up-down instability series. We first figured out the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">episode 1</a>), then computed when binaries go after the instability (i.e. the endpoint, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">episode 2</a>), and also checked binaries are really unstable in numerical relativity (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/12/15/up-down-instability-of-binary-black-holes-in-numerical-relativity/" data-type="post" data-id="3755">episode 3</a>). Now we look at the inference problem with LIGO/Virgo: if unstable up-down binaries enter the sensitivity window of the detector, will we be able to tell? We phrased the problem with some fancy stats using the so-called Savage Dickey density ratio, which is the right tool to answer this question. As is often the case, current data are not informative enough but the future is bright and loud.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>

<p>We want more! With gravitational-wave data, some quantities like the masses of the black holes are much easier to see than others. But those others are very interesting, notably spins that process and orbits that are eccentric, because they would tell us how black hole binaries came to be in the first place. So while it would be great to see those, it&#8217;s also being very hard. Some tentative claims have been made with current data, but nothing unambiguous so far. In this paper led by Isobel from Cambridge, we show that (surprise surprise&#8230;) the signals needs to be long enough before one can tell eccentricity and spin precession apart.</p>

<p>Together with my postdoc Nate, we&#8217;re proceeding our investigations on supermassive, spinning binary black holes surrounded by accretion disks (that is: a ton of gas around big monsters at the center of galaxies!). In today&#8217;s paper, we dig a bit deeper into what happens when the disk breaks. That presumably stops the interactions between the gas and the black-hole spins which could make all this funky astrophysics (spins that moves, disks that breaks, etc) actually <em>observable</em> with future gravitational-wave detectors. More needs to be done of course, but here we are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lots of &#8220;firsts&#8221; today! My <em>first</em>-year PhD student Viola just put out her <em>first</em> <em>first</em>-author paper. This is about measuring black holes with not one, but two precessing spins. People have been trying to figure out how to tell if at least one of the two spins of a merging black-hole binary is precessing for quite some time now. And maybe we&#8217;ve even done it already for one or two of the current LIGO-Virgo events. But here I must quote that epic Italian  commercial from the 90s: &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDHcjEH2syA&amp;ab_channel=PinguinoMagazine" target="_blank">two gust is megl che one</a>&#8221; (which is a terrible Italian-English mishmash on a terrible joke  to say that when you eat a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxibon" target="_blank">Maxibon</a> &#8220;two flavors are better than one&#8221;). In this paper we propose a strategy to identify sources that have the strongest evidence of two processing spins. Viola has been putting together simulated data for the next LIGO/Virgo data-taking period, and the result is pretty cool. If these binaries are out there in the Universe, we will be able to tell they have two spins going around! </p>

<p>Big stars burn everything they have, die fast, and produce big black holes. So when you see two black holes together, it&#8217;s likely that the big black hole comes from the big star. Or maybe not? Before dying, the big star can drop some mass onto the other guy, making it bigger! So now, the initially big star still produces the first black hole, but, at the end of the day, that might not be the more massive black hole anymore! This scenario is called &#8220;mass-ratio reversal&#8221; and our astrophysics friends have put together many models out there showing this is indeed possible for a good fraction of the black holes that produce gravitational-wave events. So here we ask the data: given the events LIGO and Virgo have seen so far, what&#8217;s the evidence for mass-ratio reversal in binary stars? Read Matt&#8217;s paper to find out.</p>

Going to space (I&#8217;m talking to you, LISA!) will instead give us &#8220;the last three years&#8221;. Completed together with the rest of the Birmingham crowd, this paper provides a realistic view of this truly amazing landscape. LISA observations at low frequencies in the 2030s will be paired with high-frequency data from LIGO&#8217;s successors (the so-called 3rd generation detectors). Together (and that&#8217;s crucial, together!) LISA and 3g detectors will tell us the full story of the life of merging black holes. LIGO alone is like catching up with a movie because you were late at the theatre, LISA alone is like a huge cliffhanger before the series finale&#8230; multiband observations are a bingewatching experience!</p>

<p>Daria&#8217;s new paper is out! (With key contributions from others in the <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>&#8230; This is also Viola&#8217;s first paper!). </p>



<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guys&#8230; our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but we&#8217;re interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism." target="_blank">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called &#8220;sequential prior conditioning&#8221; (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian stats&#8230;). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow. </p>

<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>
