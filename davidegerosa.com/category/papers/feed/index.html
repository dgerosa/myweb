<p>If General Relativity is too boring, couple it to something else. In this paper we study what happens to stellar collapse and supernova explosions if gravity is transmitted not only with the usual metric of Einstein&#8217;s theory (aka the graviton) but also an additional quantity. If this extra scalar field has a mass, it dramatically impacts the emitted gravitational waves&#8230; Which means that maybe, one day, one can use gravitational-wave data to figure out if scalar fields are coupled to gravity. Here we try to explore all the related phenomenology of stellar collapse with a large set of simulations covering the parameter space. And the overall picture is remarkably neat and simple!</p>

<p>The latest news from our LIGO/Virgo friends (including&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/people.php">some colleagues</a>&nbsp;here in Birmingham) was an astrophysical surprise. The black-hole binary&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08342">GW190412</a>&nbsp;is just different from every other one we have had so far. One of the two black holes is about three times larger than the other one, it&#8217;s spinning relatively fast, and that spin might even be misaligned with respect to the binary axis. That&#8217;s a lot of new things, which makes this event very challenging (but we like challenges!) to be explained with a coherent astrophysical setup. That&#8217;s what I meant by an&nbsp;<em>astrophysical</em>&nbsp;surprise. Today&#8217;s paper is our attempt to, first of all, quantify that GW190412 is indeed very unusual. Maybe it comes from a second-generation merger (that is, an event where one of the two black holes is the result of a previous merger). This might explain its features, but then the astrophysical host must be very unusual. So, yet another challenge.</p>

<p>A black-hole binary starts its life as two single black holes, and finish it as a single black hole. In between there&#8217;s all the complicated dynamics predicted by General Relativity: many orbits, dissipation of energy via gravitational waves, spins that complicate the whole business, and finally the merger which leaves behind a remnant. In this paper we put together different techniques to map this entire story beginning to end, connecting the two asymptotic conditions of a black-hole binary. This work started as a <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2019/06/21/summer-research-fun/">summer project of my students Luca</a>: well done! </p>

<p>New paper today! We&#8217;ve been working on this for a very long time but three weeks of lockdown forced us to finish it. It&#8217;s about distorted (aka warped) accretion discs surrounding black holes. If the black hole is spinning and part of a binary system, the disc behaves in a funny way. First, it&#8217;s not planar but warped to accomodate these external disturbances. Second, disc and black hole interacts and tend to reach some mutual agreement where the disc is flat and the black-hole spin is aligned. We find it&#8217;s not that easy and things are actually much more complicated: read the paper to know more about non-linear fluid viscosities,  critical obliquity, mass depletion, etc.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been knowing about the mass gap for a while, but I bet &#8220;spin gap&#8221; sounds new to you, uh? The gap in the spectrum of binary black hole masses is due to pair-instability supernovae (i.e. what happens if a giant ball of carbon and oxygen burns all at the same time).  As for the spin gap, it might be that stars collapse into black holes which have a tiny tiny spin. But that&#8217;s only for black holes that come from stars: those come out of the merger of other black holes, on the other hand, are very rapidly rotating. So, there&#8217;s a gap between these two populations. Our paper today shows that, together, mass gap and spin gap are powerful tools to figure out where black holes come from. Cluster or field? Gaps will tell.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to look into things twice. We found the up-down instability <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/">back in 2015</a> and still did not really understand what was going on.  Three out of four black hole binaries with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum are stable (in the sense that the spins stay aligned), but one is not. The impostors are the &#8220;up-down&#8221; black holes &#8211;binaries where the spin of the big black holes is aligned and the spin of the small black hole is antialigned. These guys are unstable to spin precession: small perturbation will trigger large precession cycles. Matt&#8217;s paper today figures out what&#8217;s the fate of these runaways. We find that these binaries become detectable in LIGO and LISA with very specific spin configurations: the two spins are aligned with each other and equally misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting maths in this draft (my first paper with a proof by contradiction!) as well as some astrophysics (for you, AGN disks lover). </p>

<p>The LISA data analysis problem is going to be massive: tons of simultaneous sources all together at the same time. In Birmingham we are developing a new scheme to tackle the problem, and here are the first outcomes. We populate satellite galaxies of the Milky Way with double white dwarfs and show that LISA… can actually do it! LISA will detect these guys, tell us which galaxies they come from, etc. It might even discover new small galaxies orbiting the Milky Way! Surprise, surprise, LISA is going to be amazing…</p>

<p>The Milky Way, our own Galaxy, is not alone. We&#8217;re part of a galaxy cluster, but closer in we have some satellites. The bigger ones are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (which unfortunately I&#8217;ve never seen because they are in the southern hemisphere) but also other smaller ones: faint groups of stars in the outskirts of the Milky Way. Much like all galaxies, these faint satellites will have white dwarfs, those white dwarf will form binaries, which will be observable by LISA. There&#8217;s a new population of gravitational-wave sources there waiting to be discovered!</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s paper is about superkicks. These are extreme configurations of black hole binaries which receive a large recoil. Black hole recoils work much like those of, say, a cannon. As the cannonball flies, the cannon recoils backwards. Here the binary is shooting gravitational waves: as they are emitted, the system recoils in the opposite direction. In this paper we show that superkicks might be up to 25% larger if the binary is mildly eccentric. This means it&#8217;s a bit easier to kick black holes out of stellar clusters and galaxies.</p>

<p>Gravitational-wave astronomy is, seems obvious to say, about doing astronomy with gravitational waves. One has gravitational-wave observations (thanks LIGO and Virgo!) on hand and astrophysical models on the other hand. The more closely these two sides interact, the more we  can hope to use gravitational-wave data to learn about the astrophysics of the sources. Today&#8217;s paper with JHU student Kaze Wong tries to further stimulate this dialog. And, well, one needs to throw some artificial intelligence in the game. There are three players now (astrophysics, gravitational waves, and machine learning) and things get even  more interesting.</p>
