<p>This is a fun IMBH story we worked out when Kostas and Luca <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/07/16/many-visitors/" data-type="post" data-id="6083">were visiting</a> last summer from JHU. What if (one day, who knows) we observe a highly spinning intermediate-mass black hole? If that happens, is going to be puzzling because IMBH that grow in clusters by mergers of smaller black holes tend to spin down, not up. This is a funny property of black holes, namely that extracting spins is easier than putting it in, so on average black holes slow down after they have merged many times. So if we see an IMBH with large spins, the spin must come from somewhere else. Where? Maybe gas. The argument then is that one can actually convert an IMBH spin measurement into the minimum amount of gas that must have been accreted to get that spin. </p>

<p>All right I think this is great (but it took me a long time to convince myself and the others that&#8217;s the case!) In gravitational-wave astronomy we measure binaries, that is, pairs of two objects. Our signals have information about the pair as a whole. At the same time, we care very much about separating those two objects and measuring the properties of individual black holes and neutron stars. We always do that operation without thinking twice, just say that for each posterior sample object &#8220;1&#8221; is that with the larger mass and object &#8220;2&#8221; is that with the lower mass. But is that ok? Surely it&#8217;s a choice, but is it the best one? What does it even mean to pick the &#8220;best&#8221; labels? I think machine learning can help us here and that this problem can be framed using the language of semi-supervised clustering. The results? Well, they seem very significant. Measurements of the black-hole spins are more accurate, you can tell more easily if that&#8217;s a black hole or a neutron star, and overall the posterior distributions just look nicer (go away nasty multimodalities and non-Gaussianities!). </p>

<p>The ringdown is the final bit of a gravitational-wave signal, after the two black holes have merged. It&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s clean; GR is so powerful that all that comes out after a black hole merger has specific frequencies, the fantastic &#8220;quasi-normal modes.&#8221;  While the frequencies only depend on that final BH (thanks Kerr!), the excitations of those frequencies depend on all that happened before, i.e. the merger process itself. In this summer paper by Costantino and the rest of us, we present a new accurate approximant to those amplitudes. Now go home and test GR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>&#8230; and we&#8217;re <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/07/15/gravitational-wave-selection-effects-using-neural-network-classifiers/" data-type="post" data-id="3542">back to</a> selection effects. That means modeling what you cannot see. The black holes that gravitational-wave detectors observe are not representative of those that are out there in the Universe. Some are easier to see, some are harder. Quantifying how much easier and harder is crucial to properly understand the underlying astrophysics. In this paper (which came <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/09/20/students-going-for-3g-ringdowns-and-selection-effects/" data-type="post" data-id="5605">out of a BSc student project</a>!), we go back to the basics and work out gravitational-wave selection effects one step after the other, using and refining the most common approximation. Two things to remember: including noise fluctuations is easy, and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 11 is probably ok. </p>

<p>And the second paper on the arxiv today is Daria&#8217;s masterpiece! pAGN (which Daria says you should read &#8220;pagan&#8221;) is a brand new, super cool code that implements the hydrodynamics of AGN disks, at least in their most popular one-dimensional fashion. Those solutions have been around for a long time but their details were, well, let&#8217;s say unclear. Daria went through everything from beginning to end, coming up with the &#8220;one-stop solution for your AGN disc needs&#8221; (that was actually the working title of the paper&#8230;). So <a href="https://github.com/DariaGangardt/pAGN">pip install pAGN</a> and have fun.    </p>

<p>This is the first of two papers on the arxiv today: it&#8217;s fun when two long, very different projects by different people just happen to be done on the same day! This paper is by my former colleague Nate Steinle (now a postdoc in Manitoba, Canada). Here we connect the dynamics of jets in AGN disks to the spin of black holes observable by LISA. And show the latter is a diagnostic of the former! And it&#8217;s nice to see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/04/08/the-bardeen-petterson-effect-in-accreting-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-a-systematic-approach/" data-type="post" data-id="3165">my disk-binary</a> code being used for something I didn&#8217;t think of when I wrote it.</p>

<p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em>&#8230; Call me an ambulance.</p>



<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because it&#8217;s not centered on the galaxy (it&#8217;s a bit off) and it&#8217;s also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered it&#8217;s all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found that&#8230; mmh, well, it&#8217;s a maybe.  </p>
