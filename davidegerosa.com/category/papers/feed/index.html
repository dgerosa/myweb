<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Spinning black holes are weird (well, all black holes are weird but those that spin are the worse!). They have a funny thing called ergoregion where orbiting particles can have negative energy. Penrose was the first to realize that this can be exploited to extract energy from the black hole itself. The thing is, even if you figure out how to do it, you&#8217;re inevitably going to spin the black hole down. At the end of the day, you&#8217;re left with a fossil black hole that does not have any spin. The mass of that leftover black hole (&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s for lunch dear? Fancy some sushi or prefer a black hole?&#8221;</em>) is called irreducible mass. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Hawking</a> (another giant!) figured out this has to do with thermodynamics. </p>



<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber" target="_blank">Weber</a>&#8216;s claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGO&#8217;s black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their &#8220;irreversibility&#8221;, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Breaking things is fun! In the <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/04/08/the-bardeen-petterson-effect-in-accreting-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-a-systematic-approach/" data-type="post" data-id="3165">previous paper</a> of this series, we looked at accretion disks around massive black-hole binaries and found things were going awry. We kept on finding configurations that our implementation could not handle&#8230; And now we know this is real! Finding disk solutions when the spin of the black hole has a large misalignment is just not possible! And that&#8217;s because the disk really breaks into different sections. We&#8217;ve now checked it with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical numerical simulations that not only confirm what we suspected but also show some funny things (like breaking being prevented by disk spirals, etc). I was serious, breaking things is real fun!</p>

<p>Great Scott, a new paper! When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together. The issue Matt and I are tackling here is that one needs to be consistent with putting together different events when fitting the entire population. This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here). In that case, it&#8217;s dangerous to put together events taken at different stages of their evolution. And the solution to this problem is&#8230;. time travel! We show that but propagating binaries backward in time, one can put all sources on the same footing. After that, estimating the impact of the detector requires traveling forward in time, so going &#8220;back to the future&#8221;. After all, we all know that post-Newtonian black-hole binary integrations look like this:</p>

<p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka &#8220;parameter estimation&#8221;), all of them together (aka &#8220;population&#8221;), or each of them individually while they&#8217;re together. That&#8217;s what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, don&#8217;t do this at home.</p>

<p>Today we go deep into the perilous world of binary population synthesis! Using Nicola&#8217;s code <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://mobse-webpage.netlify.app/about/" target="_blank">MOBSE</a>, our master student Maciej has implemented some new prescriptions for how supernovae explode and produce compact objects. In practice, we use the compactness (that&#8217;s mass over radius) of the stellar core before the explosion to decide if that specific star will form a neutron star or a black hole. This now needs to be compared carefully with gravitational-wave data, but we suggest that there are two key signatures one should look for: the lowest black hole masses and the relative merger rates between black holes and neutron stars.  </p>

<p>LISA is going to be great and will detect stuff from white dwarfs to those supermassive black-hole that live at the center of galaxies. If we&#8217;re lucky (yeah, who knows how many of these we will see), LISA might also detect some smaller black holes, similar to those that LIGO now sees all the time, but at a much earlier stage of their lives. But if we&#8217;re indeed lucky, the science we would take home is outstanding. Using simulated data from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lisa-ldc.lal.in2p3.fr/" target="_blank">LISA Data Challenge</a> we unleash the new amazing parameter-estimation code Balrog (don&#8217;t ask what it means, it&#8217;s just a name, not one of those surreal astronomy acronyms) at this problem. Dive into the paper for some real data-analysis fun!</p>

<p id="block-528ecece-3c90-42d2-9ca4-459e06506037">Who are the parents of LIGO&#8217;s black holes? Stars, most likely. Things like those we see in the sky at night will eventually surrender to gravity and collapse. Some of them will form black holes. Some of them will form binary black holes. Some of them will merge. Some of them will be observed by LIGO. That&#8217;s the vanilla story at least, but it might not apply to all of the black holes that LIGO sees. For some of those, stars might be the grandparents or the great grandparents. And the parents are &#8230; just other black holes! This is today&#8217;s paper lead by Vishal Baibhav. Instead of just measuring the properties of the black holes that LIGO observes, we show we can also say something about the features of the black hole parents. Read on to explore the black-hole family tree.</p>

<p>The quest of finding their astrophysical origin of merging black-hole binaries is now a key open problem in modern astrophysics. Stars are the natural progenitor of black holes: at the end of their lives, the core collapses and leaves behind a compact object. But once those &#8220;first-generation&#8221; black holes are around, they can potentially meet again and form &#8220;second generation&#8221; LIGO events. I first got interested in this problem in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2017/03/18/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers/" data-type="post" data-id="2128">2017</a> and, together with many many others researchers in the community,  we explored the consequences of this &#8220;hierarchical merger&#8221; scenario in terms of both gravitational-wave physics and astrophysical environments. In this Nature Astronomy review article, Maya and I tried to condense all this body of work into a few pages. The result is (we hope) a broad and informed overview of this emerging research strand, with a whopping number of more than 270 citations! Hope you like it.</p>

<p>Hierarchical mergers are the new black. LIGO is seeing black holes that are just too big to be there. The reason is that stars, which collapse and produce black holes, do some funny things when they get too massive. Notably, they start to spontaneously produce positrons and electrons instead of keeping their own photons. Long story short: those missing photons make the temperature go up, ignite an explosion that disrupts the core and prevents black-hole formation. This &#8220;mass gap&#8221; is a solid prediction from our astrophysics friends. In some previous papers, we and other groups pointed out that one can bypass stars and form black holes from previous black holes (and goodbye my dear maximum mass limit!). But now our astrophysics friends are telling us they can also evade the limit with some more elaborate astro-magic (winds, rotation, dredge-up, reaction rates, accretion). Today&#8217;s paper is about telling the two apart, with a key prediction: a black hole with large mass but low spin would raise a glass to the astro-wizards.</p>
