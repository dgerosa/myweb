										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>&#8230; and we&#8217;re <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/07/15/gravitational-wave-selection-effects-using-neural-network-classifiers/" data-type="post" data-id="3542">back to</a> selection effects. That means modeling what you cannot see. The black holes that gravitational-wave detectors observe are not representative of those that are out there in the Universe. Some are easier to see, some are harder. Quantifying how much easier and harder is crucial to properly understand the underlying astrophysics. In this paper (which came <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/09/20/students-going-for-3g-ringdowns-and-selection-effects/" data-type="post" data-id="5605">out of a BSc student project</a>!), we go back to the basics and work out gravitational-wave selection effects one step after the other, using and refining the most common approximation. Two things to remember: including noise fluctuations is easy, and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 11 is probably ok. </p>

<p>Population 3 stars are like &#8220;the original&#8221; stars. Those formed with material that comes straight from the Big Bang. It would be very (like, a lot!) cool to see them with gravitational-wave detectors. But can we tell them apart? Or do they look like all the other stars? Here is an attempt with a fancy machine-learning classifier.</p>

<p>And the second paper on the arxiv today is Daria&#8217;s masterpiece! pAGN (which Daria says you should read &#8220;pagan&#8221;) is a brand new, super cool code that implements the hydrodynamics of AGN disks, at least in their most popular one-dimensional fashion. Those solutions have been around for a long time but their details were, well, let&#8217;s say unclear. Daria went through everything from beginning to end, coming up with the &#8220;one-stop solution for your AGN disc needs&#8221; (that was actually the working title of the paper&#8230;). So <a href="https://github.com/DariaGangardt/pAGN">pip install pAGN</a> and have fun.    </p>

<p>This is the first of two papers on the arxiv today: it&#8217;s fun when two long, very different projects by different people just happen to be done on the same day! This paper is by my former colleague Nate Steinle (now a postdoc in Manitoba, Canada). Here we connect the dynamics of jets in AGN disks to the spin of black holes observable by LISA. And show the latter is a diagnostic of the former! And it&#8217;s nice to see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/04/08/the-bardeen-petterson-effect-in-accreting-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-a-systematic-approach/" data-type="post" data-id="3165">my disk-binary</a> code being used for something I didn&#8217;t think of when I wrote it.</p>

<p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em>&#8230; Call me an ambulance.</p>



<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because it&#8217;s not centered on the galaxy (it&#8217;s a bit off) and it&#8217;s also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered it&#8217;s all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found that&#8230; mmh, well, it&#8217;s a maybe.  </p>

<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

<p>&#8230;and we&#8217;re back to testing GR. We&#8217;ve got many gravitational-wave events and would like to use them <em>all together</em> to figure out if our equations for gravity are correct. And here is the issue: there&#8217;s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we&#8217;ve observed. Now that&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I&#8217;m not a language guy but indeed &#8220;Universe&#8221; means like <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe">&#8220;the whole thing&#8221;</a>). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it &#8220;the cosmic variance of testing GR&#8221;.  It&#8217;s bad, but the <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html">Baron Munchauseen</a> tells us we can bootstrap. </p>

<p>Gravitational-wave data keep on giving us surprises. The most outstanding one IMO is an observed correlation between mass ratios and spins of the black holes, which was first found by Tom Callister and friends. That is so, so weird&#8230; to the point that virtually zero astrophysical models so far can explain it fully and consistently. Well, we can&#8217;t either (at least not fully and consistently) but we think this paper is a nice attempt. The secret seems to be the symmetry of the astrophysical environment one considers, and  data tends to prefer black holes assembled in cylindrical symmetry. That&#8217;s also weird to be honest, but there&#8217;s a candidate for this setup, namely accretion disks and their migration traps. Who knows, more data will tell. </p>



<p>&#8230; and huge congrats to my MSc student Alessandro who managed to publish a paper even before graduating!</p>
