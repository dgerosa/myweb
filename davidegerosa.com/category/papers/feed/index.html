<p>Welcome to the beautiful world of SBI, with this terrific piece of work by Pippa Cole. Here we&#8217;re looking at extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), that is, a small black hole orbiting a big black hole, which will be (one day) detected by LISA. These signals are nasty (long and of a very complicated morphology). We&#8217;re trying something new here &#8211; a deep learning called &#8220;truncated marginal neural ratio estimation&#8221; that does not even require writing down the likelihood of the problem. Just simulate all you can. The answer, this thing is <em>great</em> for narrowing down the parameter space where EMRIs will be, kind of like searches do with current gravitational-wave data, but in a very different way.  </p>

<p>This paper came out of some discussions from our &#8220;<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2025/01/27/gwsnowballs-was-amazing/" data-type="post" data-id="6336">Gravitational-wave snowballs</a>&#8221; workshop in Sexten (Italy). We were discussing the good old problem of separating black-hole binary formation channels with spin measurements. Usually one says &#8220;aligned=isolated&#8221;, &#8220;isotropic=dynamical&#8221;. But then, some binaries that formed dynamically should also be eccentric. What we then realized is that, for those eccentric binaries and only for those, spin measurements can actually tell <em>which</em> of the dynamical channel (because there are many&#8230;) is at play.  </p>

Well, this is a hard problem! It&#8217;s not even clear which mode is the stronger one anymore, and finding suitable coordinates is not at all trivial. While this is just a first exploration, there&#8217;s so much interesting phenomenology here! Do it yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/cpacilio/postmerger">postmerger</a> package.</p>

<p>Great paper led by <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/03/23/three-more/" data-type="post" data-id="5876">our former MSc student</a> Alessandro today! This is about combining the distributions of gravitational waves and galaxies to do cosmology. These two probes measure different things (distance and redshift, respectively), so their distributions will &#8220;match&#8221; only if the cosmological model is right. You can actually use this to <em>measure</em> the cosmological model itself. Short answer: putting together 3G detectors and Euclid is a great idea. </p>

<p>When inferring black holes from gravitational-wave data, we tend to do two things, one after the other. First, we consider each event individually and measure its parameters (masses, spins, etc). Then we consider all the events together and measure the population properties. This is what we do all the time, but, actually, if objects are now part of a population, those parameters should be looked at again in light of all the others. This full problem (all parameters of all the events plus the population parameters) is daunting, and <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2021/08/06/population-informed-priors-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy/" data-type="post" data-id="4498">in the past</a> we used an indirect and somewhat convoluted approach. We got back to it now, and this time, we managed to do it head-on. Let me introduce this giant 500-dimensional sampling of the full population problem! </p>

<p>Long gravitational-wave signals are, well, long. And long often means painful, as more data need to be stored and processed. Kind of intuitively, the solution might be that of cutting things into chunks, so that long becomes short. Here we apply this idea to the popular inner product entering all gravitational-wave pipelines; this is a key building block of everything we do. The answer is that using SFTs, &#8220;Short-time Fourier Transforms&#8221;, can make things faster by more than 3 orders of magnitudes, sometimes 5. We think this is <em>the</em> solution to future gravitational-wave data analysis problems (think LISA and 3G&#8230;).</p>

<p>General relativity has this beautiful property that coordinates are meaningless. You can change them at will, which means they don&#8217;t contain any physics. And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but that&#8217;s killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself. The paper is on the maths-heavy side of things, but the results are great. Peters, you were basically right, but not quite.</p>

<p>Quasar 3C 186 strikes back! Matteo and I got interested in this funny quasar last year (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/02/16/astrophysical-and-relativistic-modeling-of-the-recoiling-black-hole-candidate-in-quasar-3c-186/" data-type="post" data-id="5769">see this one</a>). When our paper hit the arxiv, we got contacted by the real astronomers who take actual data, who told us they had even more beautiful data. We ended up contributing with our relativistic model and&#8230; well&#8230; everything seems to work. 3C 186 is indeed a recoiling black hole (it might be a rare one, but we&#8217;ve observed it nonetheless). The abstract says &#8220;decisive,&#8221; and this is indeed the right word.</p>

<p>Gravitational-wave population people talk all the time about parametric vs non-parametric methods. Parametric methods mean imposing our astrophysical knowledge on how we look at GW data. This is great, we do want to extract astrophysical knowledge, but what if we don&#8217;t know what to look for? The statisticians tell us to go non-parametric, which means using a flexible model that can fit whatever you want. That&#8217;s great, but what do we learn then? In other words, where&#8217;s the boundary between flexibility and interpretability? Today&#8217;s paper shows that one can conceptually separate these two processes and extract parametric results from non-parametric fits. I&#8217;m very proud of this piece of work, which was <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/20/cecilia-et-al/" data-type="post" data-id="6143">Cecilia Fabbri</a>&#8216;s MSc thesis project and was actually kickstarted by one of my previous students, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/10/28/2-msc-2-bsc/" data-type="post" data-id="5623">Alessandro Santini</a>. We even wrote <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">a poem</a> about this!</p>

<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>
