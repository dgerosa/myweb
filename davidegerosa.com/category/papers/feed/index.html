<p>General relativity has this beautiful property that coordinates are meaningless. You can change them at will, which means they don&#8217;t contain any physics. And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but that&#8217;s killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself. The paper is on the maths-heavy side of things, but the results are great. Peters, you were basically right, but not quite.</p>

<p>Quasar 3C 186 strikes back! Matteo and I got interested in this funny quasar last year (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/02/16/astrophysical-and-relativistic-modeling-of-the-recoiling-black-hole-candidate-in-quasar-3c-186/" data-type="post" data-id="5769">see this one</a>). When our paper hit the arxiv, we got contacted by the real astronomers who take actual data, who told us they had even more beautiful data. We ended up contributing with our relativistic model and&#8230; well&#8230; everything seems to work. 3C 186 is indeed a recoiling black hole (it might be a rare one, but we&#8217;ve observed it nonetheless). The abstract says &#8220;decisive,&#8221; and this is indeed the right word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gravitational-wave population people talk all the time about parametric vs non-parametric methods. Parametric methods mean imposing our astrophysical knowledge on how we look at GW data. This is great, we do want to extract astrophysical knowledge, but what if we don&#8217;t know what to look for? The statisticians tell us to go non-parametric, which means using a flexible model that can fit whatever you want. That&#8217;s great, but what do we learn then? In other words, where&#8217;s the boundary between flexibility and interpretability? Today&#8217;s paper shows that one can conceptually separate these two processes and extract parametric results from non-parametric fits. I&#8217;m very proud of this piece of work, which was <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/20/cecilia-et-al/" data-type="post" data-id="6143">Cecilia Fabbri</a>&#8216;s MSc thesis project and was actually kickstarted by one of my previous students, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/10/28/2-msc-2-bsc/" data-type="post" data-id="5623">Alessandro Santini</a>. We even wrote <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">a poem</a> about this!</p>

<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>

<p>Our &#8220;popfisher&#8221; paper is finally out! (and now Viola can submit her PhD thesis). This is about next-generation (aka 3G) gravitational wave detectors. Those beasts will measure millions of black holes&#8230; and with so many of them who cares about each source individually. The important thing will be the population of objects, i.e. how those black holes are distributed as a whole. Measuring populations is an interesting but convoluted statistical problem. Here we implement a quick shortcut (the Fisher matrix) and show that yes, 3G detectors will be amazing&#8230; but more amazing for some things than for others.</p>

<p>LISA will see a gazillion white dwarfs, but we won&#8217;t, or at least not individually. Those signals will actually pile up together in a mashed potato thing called foreground. But this mashed potato won&#8217;t be smooth (translate: the gravitational-wave signal won&#8217;t be stationary and Gaussian) and this structure can indeed be precious for extracting more information from LISA. But first, let&#8217;s taste this with today&#8217;s paper, i.e. characterize the foreground.</p>

<p>This is a fun IMBH story we worked out when Kostas and Luca <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/07/16/many-visitors/" data-type="post" data-id="6083">were visiting</a> last summer from JHU. What if (one day, who knows) we observe a highly spinning intermediate-mass black hole? If that happens, is going to be puzzling because IMBH that grow in clusters by mergers of smaller black holes tend to spin down, not up. This is a funny property of black holes, namely that extracting spins is easier than putting it in, so on average black holes slow down after they have merged many times. So if we see an IMBH with large spins, the spin must come from somewhere else. Where? Maybe gas. The argument then is that one can actually convert an IMBH spin measurement into the minimum amount of gas that must have been accreted to get that spin. </p>

<p>All right I think this is great (but it took me a long time to convince myself and the others that&#8217;s the case!) In gravitational-wave astronomy we measure binaries, that is, pairs of two objects. Our signals have information about the pair as a whole. At the same time, we care very much about separating those two objects and measuring the properties of individual black holes and neutron stars. We always do that operation without thinking twice, just say that for each posterior sample object &#8220;1&#8221; is that with the larger mass and object &#8220;2&#8221; is that with the lower mass. But is that ok? Surely it&#8217;s a choice, but is it the best one? What does it even mean to pick the &#8220;best&#8221; labels? I think machine learning can help us here and that this problem can be framed using the language of semi-supervised clustering. The results? Well, they seem very significant. Measurements of the black-hole spins are more accurate, you can tell more easily if that&#8217;s a black hole or a neutron star, and overall the posterior distributions just look nicer (go away nasty multimodalities and non-Gaussianities!). </p>

<p>The ringdown is the final bit of a gravitational-wave signal, after the two black holes have merged. It&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s clean; GR is so powerful that all that comes out after a black hole merger has specific frequencies, the fantastic &#8220;quasi-normal modes.&#8221;  While the frequencies only depend on that final BH (thanks Kerr!), the excitations of those frequencies depend on all that happened before, i.e. the merger process itself. In this summer paper by Costantino and the rest of us, we present a new accurate approximant to those amplitudes. Now go home and test GR.</p>
