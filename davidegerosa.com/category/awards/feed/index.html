<p>The 2017 paper&nbsp;&#8220;<strong>Are merging black holes born from stellar collapse or previous mergers?</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;that I wrote with<a href="https://pages.jh.edu/eberti2/posts/2025-frontiers-of-science-award/"> Emanuele Berti</a> was selected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icbs.cn">2025 Frontiers of Science Award</a>. These prizes are awarded by the International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS), sponsored by the City of Beijing and the Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Application (BIMSA). Every year, they select influential recent papers in Physics, Maths, and Computer Science. </p>



<p>The complete list of Physics papers selected for awards is available&nbsp;<a href="http://davidegerosa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025FSA_Physics.pdf">here</a>. Ours is one of only three papers that were selected in the category&nbsp;<em>Astrophysics and Cosmology &#8211; Theory</em>. We&#8217;ll collect the award in July at the Great Hall of the People of China in Beijing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy to see how a seemingly simple idea we had (<em>&#8220;What if LIGO&#8217;s black holes merge multiple times?&#8221;</em>) went so far! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2017/03/18/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers/" data-type="post" data-id="2128">Our paper</a>&nbsp;was published in Physical Review D in 2017, selected as an&nbsp;<em>Editor’s Suggestion</em> back then&#8230; and now got an award!</p>

Viola and I will study the extraction of spin-spin couplings from black-hole binaries using gravitational-wave data and stochastic sampling techniques. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>It is a true honor to receive the career Prize for Young Researchers of the Italian Society for General Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV). I was awarded the prize in the class of relativistic astrophysics. It&#8217;s amazing to be recognized in my home country; it&#8217;s great to be back! Let me thank all my mentors, advisors, collaborators, and now students who are walking with me in the adventure of science.</p>



<p>Here is me with the president of the society Fulvio Ricci. And here are press releases from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/news/davide-gerosa-premio-assegnato-dalla-societ%C3%A0-italiana-relativit%C3%A0-generale-e-fisica-della" target="_blank">University of Milan-Bicocca</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.infn.it/it/news-infn/4527-sigrav-premiati-tre-giovani-ricercatori-infn-e-assegnata-a-heino-falcke-e-ad-andrzej-mariusz-trautman-la-medaglia-amaldi" target="_blank">INFN</a>. </p>
