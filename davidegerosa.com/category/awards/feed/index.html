<p>Huge huge congrats to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Roupas%2C%20Zacharias%22&amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;p_=0">Zacharias Roupas</a> who was awarded a Marie Curie Fellowship with us! Zachos is currently based at the British University in Egypt and will be joining my group in Milan in the Fall of 2024. The Marie Curie Fellowship program is a prestigious postdoctoral scheme operating at the EU level and,  together with <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2022/06/03/super-arianna/" data-type="post" data-id="5464">Arianna</a>, we&#8217;ll now have two Marie Curie grantees in the group. Zachos&#8217; winning proposal is titled <em>&#8220;Black hole spin and mass function in gaseous proto-clusters&#8221;</em> (nickname: protoBH). </p>

Viola and I will study the extraction of spin-spin couplings from black-hole binaries using gravitational-wave data and stochastic sampling techniques. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>It is a true honor to receive the career Prize for Young Researchers of the Italian Society for General Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV). I was awarded the prize in the class of relativistic astrophysics. It&#8217;s amazing to be recognized in my home country; it&#8217;s great to be back! Let me thank all my mentors, advisors, collaborators, and now students who are walking with me in the adventure of science.</p>



<p>Here is me with the president of the society Fulvio Ricci. And here are press releases from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/news/davide-gerosa-premio-assegnato-dalla-societ%C3%A0-italiana-relativit%C3%A0-generale-e-fisica-della" target="_blank">University of Milan-Bicocca</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.infn.it/it/news-infn/4527-sigrav-premiati-tre-giovani-ricercatori-infn-e-assegnata-a-heino-falcke-e-ad-andrzej-mariusz-trautman-la-medaglia-amaldi" target="_blank">INFN</a>. </p>
