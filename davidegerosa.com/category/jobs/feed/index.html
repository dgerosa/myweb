<p>In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for strong, highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. The candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of &#8220;open&#8221; scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default.&nbsp; In addition, our group sponsors two specific positions:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;Gravitational-wave data and black-hole binary dynamics&#8221;, supervised by Gerosa. Possible research directions include&nbsp;statistical inference from LIGO/Virgo and LISA data, application of machine-learning tools to gravitational-wave astronomy, and theoretical investigations of black-hole binaries.</li><li>&#8220;Dynamics of massive black hole binaries in dense stellar systems&#8221;, supervised by Sesana and Gualandris. This is a dual-doctorate position in partnership with the University of Surrey, UK.&nbsp;The main focus is the understanding of binary evolution using N-body simulations and analytical modeling. The successful candidate will spend 50% of their time at Bicocca and 50%&nbsp;of their time at Surrey.</li></ul>



<p>Candidates wishing to be considered for these additional positions should mention it explicitly in their application.</p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for a 3+2 year research position in HPC applications to astrophysics.</p>



<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, galactic dynamics, and numerical relativity. This is embedded in a wider astronomical context including both observational and experimental activities. Our group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Science Board, the European Pulsar Timing Array, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Staff members with matching interests include Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Lupi, and Sesana.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner. Art, culture, and food are outstanding. The city hosts three international airports with worldwide connections.</p>



<p>This recruitment campaign is part of a wider national initiative supporting HPC-related computational activities throughout the country. This is a major investment program directly supported by the European Union. It will provide the most ideal context for ambitious candidates wishing to develop and apply state-of-the-art computational and machine-learning tools to current astrophysical and gravitational-wave modeling issues.</p>



<p>The researcher will be appointed at the so-called &#8220;RTDA&#8221; level for 3 years. The contract can also be extended for 2 more years depending on funding availability.&nbsp; The starting date is negotiable, with the earliest and latest dates on January 1st, 2023 and May 1st, 2023, respectively. RTDA researchers are full-time university employees (with full benefits, such as health insurance and pension plan), have limited teaching duties, and are eligible to fully supervise research MSc student projects. This is an ideal setup for early-career researchers wishing to transition toward research independence and start developing their own group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The successful candidate will have a PhD in Physics, Astronomy, Computer Science, or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: HPC workflows, GPU software development, computational astrophysics, gravitational-wave astronomy, numerical relativity, statistical data analysis, machine learning.</p>



<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for two reference letters to be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups. Women are especially encouraged to apply. For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Bruno Giacomazzo (<a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a>) or Davide Gerosa (<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>).</p>

<p>Here below is my project description:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Astrophysics and phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources with LIGO and LISA</strong><br>This project concentrates on developing theoretical and astrophysical prediction s of gravitational-wave sources. The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be &#8220;golden&#8221; events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. </em></p></blockquote>
