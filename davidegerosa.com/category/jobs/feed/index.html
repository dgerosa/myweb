<p>The <a href="http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/people.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (opens in a new tab)">Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</a> at the University of Birmingham, UK, invites applications for postdoctoral positions.</p>



<p>The Institute provides a vibrant and diverse environment with expertise covering theoretical and experimental gravitational-wave research, with applications to present and future-generation detectors, theoretical astrophysics, transient astronomy, gravitational-wave source modeling, and general relativity theory. Applications from top researchers in all areas related to gravitational-wave and transient astronomy are encouraged.</p>



<p>Institute faculty members include Andreas Freise, Davide Gerosa, Denis Martynov, Haixing Miao, Christopher Moore, Conor Mow-Lowry, Matt Nicholl, Patricia Schmidt, Silvia Toonen, and Alberto Vecchio.</p>



<p>One postdoctoral appointment is <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2019/12/12/leverhulme-trust-research-grant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="funded by the UK Leverhulme Trust (opens in a new tab)">funded by the UK Leverhulme Trust</a> (PI Dr. Davide Gerosa) and is focused on developing astrophysical and statistical predictions for the LISA space mission. The successful candidate will have ample opportunities to explore other areas of gravitational-wave astronomy as well.</p>



<p>Appointments will be for a three-year term starting in the Fall of 2020 and come with generous research and travel budget.</p>



<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications, and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. Complete applications should be received by 27 January 2020 for full consideration. Applications should be sent to Ms. Joanne Cox at: j.s.cox@bham.ac.uk.<br>Applicants should also arrange for 3 reference letters to be sent by 27 January 2020 to the same email address.</p>



<p>For further information and informal inquiries please contact Dr. Davide Gerosa (d.gerosa@bham.ac.uk) and Prof. Alberto Vecchio (av@star.sr.bham.ac.uk).</p>

<p>Here below is my project description:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Astrophysics and phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources with LIGO and LISA</strong><br>This project concentrates on developing theoretical and astrophysical prediction s of gravitational-wave sources. The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be &#8220;golden&#8221; events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. </em></p></blockquote>
