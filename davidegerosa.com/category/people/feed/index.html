<p>Two students just completed their Bachelor&#8217;s degree with research projects in our group. Leonardo Toti worked with myself and Giulia Fumagalli on exploring black-hole merger trees in dense clusters, while Simone Restuccia worked with Costantino Pacilio on applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to black-hole ringdowns. I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them &#8220;physicists&#8221; for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial phase is imposing: &#8220;<em>coi poteri conferitami&#8230;</em>&#8220;). Congrats Simone and Leonardo! </p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>

<li>Francesco Iacovelli is visiting us for 7 (!) months from Geneva with a grant from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.istitutosvizzero.it/it/" target="_blank">Istituto Svizzero</a>.

<li>Chris Moore, a longstanding collaborator from the University of Birmingham will be here at the end of October</li>



<li>Clement Bonnerot (now in Copenhagen but about to move to the UK for a faculty job, congrats!) will join us in late November.</li>



<li>Swetha Baghwat will be visiting Milan from Birmingham in November as well.</li>



<li>And Lieke van Son, Phd student at Harvard and population-synthesis mastermind, will be here in early December.</li>
