<p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I&#8217;m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots&#8230;). All the best for what comes next!</p>

<p>We&#8217;re at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore) today, for a brainstorming workshop we organized together with the gravity groups at JHU and Penn State. A ton of interesting people, cool science, fun numerics, big black holes, future detectors, and many new exciting projects we all want to start. The idea is to get &#8220;a little help from my (gravity) friends&#8221;.

<p>We have a new friend in the group! Meredith Vogel is joining us for her undergraduate summer research project. Meredith is e-visiting us from Missouri State University (but will soon start her grad school at the University of Florida*) and will be working with Matt on numerical-relativity surrogate models. Meredith&#8217;s project is part of the <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/ireu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IREU</a> (International Summer Research) program, which is a great opportunity for US students to visit groups abroad, including us! Welcome Meredith, looking forward to seeing your great science.</p>
