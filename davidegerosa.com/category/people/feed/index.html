Zachos is currently based at the British University in Egypt and will be joining my group in Milan in the Fall of 2024. The Marie Curie Fellowship program is a prestigious postdoctoral scheme operating at the EU level and,  together with <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2022/06/03/super-arianna/" data-type="post" data-id="5464">Arianna</a>, we&#8217;ll now have two Marie Curie grantees in the group. Zachos&#8217; winning proposal is titled <em>&#8220;Black hole spin and mass function in gaseous proto-clusters&#8221;</em> (nickname: protoBH). </p>

<p>Hey Chris, just wanted to say thanks because you wanted to understand what was going on, for that ski run down the Highland Bowl in Aspen, for sending me yet another version of those StarTrack files I had to postprocess, for those obscure code comments in Polish, for that last chat in Japan last month (I&#8217;ll finish that calculation about tides we sketched at the board!), and for the energy. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re on a beautiful mountain.</p>

<p>Much like Spotify, here is our group &#8220;Wrapped&#8221;, 2023 edition!</p>



<p>Some of the group highlights include&#8230;  We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davide&#8217;s ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>



<p>&#8230; now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated. </p>



<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>
