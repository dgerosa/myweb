I&#8217;m sad to leave the amazing group in Birmingham, but also very excited at this new tremendous opportunity.</p>

<p>We have a new friend in the group! Meredith Vogel is joining us for her undergraduate summer research project. Meredith is e-visiting us from Missouri State University (but will soon start her grad school at the University of Florida*) and will be working with Matt on numerical-relativity surrogate models. Meredith&#8217;s project is part of the <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/ireu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IREU</a> (International Summer Research) program, which is a great opportunity for US students to visit groups abroad, including us! Welcome Meredith, looking forward to seeing your great science.</p>

<p>This is a quick update some of our group activities&#8230; In the past few months we&#8217;ve been busy learning about the formation of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in the disks of active galactic nuclei. We organized a journal club and studied one paper each week on this &#8220;new&#8221; formation channel for LIGO sources. We discussed a ton of topics, going from disk accretion to migration traps, LIGO rates, AGN variability, GW counterparts, hierarchical mergers, all the way to EMRIs.  </p>



<p>Let me thanks all those who took part and presented papers including Daria, Matt (1), Chris, Eliot, Matt (2), Alberto, Evan, Riccardo, and Sean. </p>



<p>Here is a log of all the sessions: <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/" target="_blank">davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks</a></p>

<p>Two close collaborators will be visiting my group this winter. </p>



<p><a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~vvarma/">Vijay Varma</a>, postdoc at Caltech and expert of numerical relativity surrogate models, will be here on October 7-11. Get ready for his talk <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;Binary black hole simulations: from supercomputers to your laptop&quot; (opens in a new tab)" href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/talk/index/3838" target="_blank">&#8220;Binary black hole simulations: from supercomputers to your laptop&#8221;</a></em> (aka: Everything you ever wanted to know about waveform surrogates). </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giovanni Rosotti (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/giovanni-rosotti#tab-1" target="_blank">Giovanni Rosotti</a>, Veni fellow in Leiden, will be here on November 4-15. He will also give a talk: <em>&#8220;<a href="http://The observational era of planet formation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The observational era of planet formation (opens in a new tab)">The observational era of planet formation</a>&#8220;</em>. What do planets have to do with black holes? Turns out some stages of their evolution are set by the same equations. We have a lot to learn from each other! Giovanni&#8217;s visit is supported by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GWverse (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">GWverse</a> COST Action (thanks EU!).</p>
