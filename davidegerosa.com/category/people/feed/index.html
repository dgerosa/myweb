<p>Much like Spotify, here is our group &#8220;Wrapped&#8221;, 2023 edition!</p>



<p>Some of the group highlightsÂ include&#8230;Â  We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remainsÂ our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc,Â Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davide&#8217;s ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got hisÂ first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnextÂ conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>



<p>&#8230; now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

Leonardo Toti worked with myself and Giulia Fumagalli on exploring black-hole merger trees in dense clusters, while Simone Restuccia worked with Costantino Pacilio on applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to black-hole ringdowns. I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them &#8220;physicists&#8221; for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial phase is imposing: &#8220;<em>coi poteri conferitami&#8230;</em>&#8220;). Congrats Simone and Leonardo! </p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>
