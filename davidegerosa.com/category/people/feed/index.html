<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated. </p>



<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>

<p>My group is hosting quite a few visitors this semester. We&#8217;re alive!</p>



<ul>
<li>Francesco Iacovelli is visiting us for 7 (!) months from Geneva with a grant from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.istitutosvizzero.it/it/" target="_blank">Istituto Svizzero</a>. Francesco has done some amazing work on forecasting the capabilities of Einstein Telescope.</li>



<li>Chris Moore, a longstanding collaborator from the University of Birmingham will be here at the end of October</li>



<li>Clement Bonnerot (now in Copenhagen but about to move to the UK for a faculty job, congrats!) will join us in late November.</li>



<li>Swetha Baghwat will be visiting Milan from Birmingham in November as well.</li>



<li>And Lieke van Son, Phd student at Harvard and population-synthesis mastermind, will be here in early December.</li>

<p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I&#8217;m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots&#8230;). All the best for what comes next!</p>
