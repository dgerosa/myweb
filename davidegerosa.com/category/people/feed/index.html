<p>Viola De Renzis is the latest addition to <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">our group</a>! Viola graduated from Rome &#8220;La Sapienza&#8221; with an MSc thesis on exotic compact objects and is now starting her PhD with me at Milan-Bicocca. Viola plays guitar, arguably better than Matt (although he runs for a million miles, and that&#8217;s when he&#8217;s tired), while Daria remains by far the best fencer in the group. Welcome, we all look forward to working with you!</p>

<p>We have a new friend in the group! Meredith Vogel is joining us for her undergraduate summer research project. Meredith is e-visiting us from Missouri State University (but will soon start her grad school at the University of Florida*) and will be working with Matt on numerical-relativity surrogate models. Meredith&#8217;s project is part of the <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/ireu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IREU</a> (International Summer Research) program, which is a great opportunity for US students to visit groups abroad, including us! Welcome Meredith, looking forward to seeing your great science.</p>

<p>This is a quick update some of our group activities&#8230; In the past few months we&#8217;ve been busy learning about the formation of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in the disks of active galactic nuclei. We organized a journal club and studied one paper each week on this &#8220;new&#8221; formation channel for LIGO sources. We discussed a ton of topics, going from disk accretion to migration traps, LIGO rates, AGN variability, GW counterparts, hierarchical mergers, all the way to EMRIs.  </p>



<p>Here is a log of all the sessions: <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/" target="_blank">davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks</a></p>



<p>Let me thanks all those who took part and presented papers including Daria, Matt (1), Chris, Eliot, Matt (2), Alberto, Evan, Riccardo, and Sean. </p>
