<p>We&#8217;re at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore) today, for a brainstorming workshop we organized together with the gravity groups at JHU and Penn State. A ton of interesting people, cool science, fun numerics, big black holes, future detectors, and many new exciting projects we all want to start. The idea is to get &#8220;a little help from my (gravity) friends&#8221;. Have a look at what we&#8217;re up to:  <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-workshop/">davidegerosa.com/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-workshop/</a></p>

<p>This is a quick update some of our group activities&#8230; In the past few months we&#8217;ve been busy learning about the formation of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in the disks of active galactic nuclei. We organized a journal club and studied one paper each week on this &#8220;new&#8221; formation channel for LIGO sources. We discussed a ton of topics, going from disk accretion to migration traps, LIGO rates, AGN variability, GW counterparts, hierarchical mergers, all the way to EMRIs.  </p>



<p>Here is a log of all the sessions: <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/" target="_blank">davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks</a></p>



<p>Let me thanks all those who took part and presented papers including Daria, Matt (1), Chris, Eliot, Matt (2), Alberto, Evan, Riccardo, and Sean. </p>

<p>This week I am organizing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/greatnetworkschool">GrEAT PhD winter school</a>. GrEAT (which stands for Gravitational-wave Excellence through Alliance Training) is a <a href="https://gilsay.physics.gla.ac.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=great_network:start">synergy network</a> between the UK and China. Our program features informal talks in the mornings and hands-on sessions in the afternoons, covering both theoretical and experimental gravitational-wave physics.</p>



<p>After the school in Birmingham, students will move on to various UK nodes to complete longer projects. In particular, Mingyue Zhou will stay here working with me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy to report about the great success of our workshop &#8221;<a href="http://benasque.org/2018relativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Relativity beyond General Relativity</a>&#8221;. This was organized by me, Helvi Witek, and Leo Stein at the Benasque physics center (Spain), in the beautiful region of the Pyrenees, on June 3-9, 2018. Was great to see world-leading experts from so many different fields (numerical relativity, gravitational-wave data analysis, self-force, theoretical physics, cosmology, etc) interacting and reporting their progress on innovative uses of computational techniques in gravitation. <a href="http://benasque.org/2018relativity/cgi-bin/talks/allprint.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> are the conference program and (some of) the talk&#8217;s slides.</p>
<p>I only wish the rain would have stopped for more than a few hours over the entire week. This is us with Einstein; we&#8217;re all beyond!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~pcgm34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">34th edition of the Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting</a>, sponsored by the APS, was held at Caltech on March 16-17, 2018. This year&#8217; edition was organized by me, Leo Stein and a few others, and was dedicated to Jim Isenberg who first started the Pacific Gravity meetings 34 years ago. We had a beautiful blend of people (including some very talented undergrads!) and topics (from numerical relativity, to quantum gravity, high-energy physics and gravitational-wave astronomy). I hope everybody had fun. I surely did!</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~pcgm34/Schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference program</a>, and this below is the logo that I designed (It&#8217;s supposed to be Newton&#8217;s apple with some gravitational waves in Caltech&#8217;s orange color; I know, I&#8217;m a scientist, not an artist&#8230;). And congrats to Maria Okounkova who won the best student talk award of the APS.</p>

Chaired by Cathie Clarke and co-organized by me, Giovanni Rosotti and a few other people, we tried to bring together people working on both planetary and black-hole physics, to understand what we have in common&#8230; Much like planets migrate in protoplanetary discs, supermassive black holes are also brought together by gas interactions. Same physics, different scales, right?</p>
<p>Here is the conference <a href="https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2017/migration.issue.protoplanets.supermassive.black.holes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">program</a> (with some of the talk&#8217;s slides) and below is our beautiful logo (there are discs, waves, inspirals, and King&#8217;s College!). Thanks to the KAVLI and Templeton foundations for making this possible.</p>
