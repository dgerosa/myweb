<p>Together with Ilya Mandel, last week I organized a workshop titled <em>&#8220;Gravitational-wave snowballs, populations, and models&#8221;</em> in Sexten (Italy). Both the science and the scenery were just stellar! We had almost zero talks, and the entire conference was made of brainstorming sessions on three topics &#8220;Parametrization&#8221;, &#8220;Correlation,&#8221; and &#8220;Falsification.&#8221; There are already several emails circulating with several paper ideas coming out of it. Huge thanks to all those who led and participated in the discussions. Here is the conference website&#8230;</p>



<p> <a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs</a></p>



<p>&#8230; and here is us! We should definitely do it again. And remember: if you run population synthesis once, you shall be cursed forever.</p>

<p>The workshop “<em>Challenges and future perspectives in gravitational-wave astronomy: O4 and beyond</em>” will take place at the Lorentz Center (Leiden, Netherlands) from October 14th to October 18th, 2024.</p>



<p>Our goal is to foster an interdisciplinary discussion (with astrophysicists, data analysts, and machine learners) about how current and future observations of gravitational and electromagnetic waves can be used to shed light on the physics of compact-object formation and evolution.</p>



<p>We encourage interested participants to apply by July 21st, 2024 at:<br><a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html</a></p>



<p>Lorentz Workshops@Oort are scientific meetings for small groups of up to 55 participants, including both senior and junior scientists. We will dedicate a considerable amount of time to discussion sessions, thus stimulating an interactive atmosphere and encouraging collaboration between participants. The venue Lorentz Center@Oort is located at the Faculty of Science campus of Leiden University, the Netherlands. The Lorentz Center provides each participant with office space as well as various practical services such as arranging accommodations at the nearby hotel Van der Valk Hotel Leiden/Tulip Inn Leiden at a special rate, visa assistance, and bike rental. For more information see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lorentzcenter.nl</a></p>



<p><strong>SOC</strong>: Fabio Antonini (chair), Maya Fishbach, Davide Gerosa, Laura Nuttall, Rosalba Perna, Simon Portegies Zwart.</p>

<p>Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Gravitational-wave populations: what&#8217;s next?</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s been a blast! </p>



<p>An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question &#8220;<em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?</em>&#8221; and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive. </p>



<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise I&#8217;ll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view. </p>



<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize. </p>



<p>And if you couldn&#8217;t make it for whatever reason no worries, we&#8217;ll do it again!</p>

<div style="height:86px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.</strong> These are our discussion sessions</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Intro: the pieces of the population problem.</em></li>



<li><em>What can/should astrophysicists and pop-synthers predict?</em></li>



<li><em>What is the predictive power of pop-synth codes? Are we learning more than our assumptions?</em></li>



<li><em>Hierarchical Bayesian fits: can we keep on doing this? Technical difficulties, scaling with the number of events, selection effects.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the outliers. Are they in or out of your fit? If you fit something well you also need to fit the rest.</em></li>



<li><em>What is a catalog? Is p_astro the way to go? (Ir)relevance of subthreshold events.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the systematics. Are waveform/calibration impacting the population? And how about the assumed population?</em></li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;non-parametric&#8221; methods. What are they and what does it even mean</em>.</li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;parametric but informed&#8221;. Machine learning emulators for pop-synth.</em></li>



<li><em>More populations. LISA, X-ray binaries, Gaia, you name it.</em></li>



<li><em>More than individual mergers. Stochastic backgrounds, foreground removal.</em></li>



<li><em>Adding the redshift dimension: toward 3g! Use the population to do cosmology.</em></li>



<li><em>What&#8217;s next? Summary and prospects.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced class &#8220;Big data within science and industry&#8221; will take place on September 22nd at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy).</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass</a></p>



<p>Data are everywhere. Exploring scientific data is now at the heart of both scientific advances as well as industrial applications. This one-day master class provides a &#8220;learn by example&#8221; introduction to the fascinating world of big data, namely pieces of information that are so rich and structured that require targeted analysis techniques loosely referred to as machine learning or artificial intelligence.</p>



<p><br>The class is suitable for advanced MSc students, PhD students, and postdocs who wish to expand their proficiency in handling scientific data. The program features the participation of three world-leading experts from both academia and the private sector, as well as a hands-on experience for all participants.</p>



<p>For students enrolled in the Physics and Astronomy PhD program here at Milano-Bicocca, this 8-hour program will be recognized with 1 CFU. In any case, we are happy to provide attendance certificates.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to announce the workshop “Gravitational-wave populations: what’s next?” which we are currently organizing for next summer:</p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext</a></p>



<p>As the catalog of detected gravitational-wave events grows from O(10) to O(100) sources (but think millions in a few decades!), such increasingly detailed information is allowing us to dig deeper into the (astro)physics of compact objects. At the same time, new and more data require appropriately powerful statistical tools to be fully exploited. This highly interactive workshop (fewer talks, more working together!) will be the opportunity to share recent progress, identify what new steps are now needed, and hopefully set the stage for substantial progress in the field.</p>



<p>The workshop will take place on July 10-14, 2023 at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which is located near the city center of Milan, Italy. Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; nearby excursions will take you to the Italian lakes and the stunning Alps.</p>



<p>While we are unable to provide travel support, the workshop will have no registration fee. The workshop will be in person without remote options.</p>



<p>Interested participants should register on the conference website by March 1st, 2023. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline, so please do not make travel plans until you hear back from us. When registering please indicate which of the discussion session(s) you would like to contribute to. Early career scientists will have the opportunity to give flash talks highlighting their science.</p>



<p>Davide Gerosa (Milano-Bicocca), Emanuele Berti (Johns Hopkins), Salvatore Vitale (MIT)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore) today, for a brainstorming workshop we organized together with the gravity groups at JHU and Penn State. A ton of interesting people, cool science, fun numerics, big black holes, future detectors, and many new exciting projects we all want to start. The idea is to get &#8220;a little help from my (gravity) friends&#8221;.

<p>This is a quick update some of our group activities&#8230; In the past few months we&#8217;ve been busy learning about the formation of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in the disks of active galactic nuclei. We organized a journal club and studied one paper each week on this &#8220;new&#8221; formation channel for LIGO sources. We discussed a ton of topics, going from disk accretion to migration traps, LIGO rates, AGN variability, GW counterparts, hierarchical mergers, all the way to EMRIs.  </p>



<p>Here is a log of all the sessions: <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks/" target="_blank">davidegerosa.com/bhbin-agndisks</a></p>



<p>Let me thanks all those who took part and presented papers including Daria, Matt (1), Chris, Eliot, Matt (2), Alberto, Evan, Riccardo, and Sean. </p>
