<p>Our student Lisa Merlo defended her BSc 3rd year project today! Lisa worked with Pippa Cole and me on computing rates for mergers of primordial black holes, also considering a new detector prototype that the experimental group here is developing (nickname <a href="https://bicoq.fisica.unimib.it/">BAUSCIA</a>, from the Milan dialect). Short answer: the rate is low but now is more accurately low. Lisa&#8217;s presentation was amazing and working with her has been a real pleasure. Stay tuned for her future astro career!</p>

<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three of our BSc students graduated today. </p>



<ul>
<li>Ludovica Carbone worked with Michele Mancarella and Francesco Iacovellie and has some nice forecasts for 3G detectors.</li>



<li>Riccardo Bosoni de Martini was supervised by Costantino Pacilio and checked super carefully their Fisher code for ringdowns.</li>



<li>Malvina Bellotti (who, I&#8217;m very envious, is from Cortina in the mountains!) worked with me on selection effects for GW surveys. </li>
</ul>



<p>And, last but not least, let me add Simone Piscitelli, who last week defended his MSc degree at Milano Statale (&#8220;the other&#8221; University of Milan) supervised by Costantino Pacilio and myself. Simone worked on a cool test of GR. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>



<p>Congrats all!</p>

<p>Two students just completed their Bachelor&#8217;s degree with research projects in our group. </p>



<ul>
<li>Leonardo Toti worked with myself and Giulia Fumagalli on exploring black-hole merger trees in dense clusters.</li>



<li>Simone Restuccia worked with Costantino Pacilio on applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to black-hole ringdowns. </li>
</ul>



<p>I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them &#8220;physicists&#8221; for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial sentence is quite imposing: &#8220;<em>coi poteri conferitami&#8230;</em>&#8220;). Congrats Simone and Leonardo! </p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>

<p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I&#8217;m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots&#8230;). All the best for what comes next!</p>
