<p>Four BSc students and one MSc student defended their research project with us this month. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, huge congrats to Federica Tettoni who got her MSc degree in astrophysics. She worked with Viola De Renzis and myself on labeling black holes in gravitational wave events. Such a fun problem (and we got confused so many times!), more <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/13/which-is-which-identification-of-the-two-compact-objects-in-gravitational-wave-binaries/" data-type="post" data-id="6130">here</a>.</li>



<li>Rocco Giugni (BSc) worked with Matteo Boschini on finding issues in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/07/10/extending-black-hole-remnant-surrogate-models-to-extreme-mass-ratios/" data-type="post" data-id="5426">his remnant surrogate models</a>&#8230;</li>



<li>Giulia Foroni (BSc) worked with me on black-hole binary spin precession. The good old problem of the spin morphologies, but this time looking for two transitions at the same time.</li>



<li>Matilde Vergani (BSc) also worked with me; we looked at merger trees and their combinatorics problem (her presentation pictures of trees, I mean actual trees&#8230;).</li>



<li>Laura Tassoni (BSc) worked with Costantino Pacilio on ringdown data analysis. </li>
</ul>



<p>Thanks all for spending some time in our research group!</p>

<p>Four students just graduated with projects in our group&#8230; </p>



<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2022/02/23/congrats-cecilia/" data-type="post" data-id="4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, it&#8217;s always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit you&#8217;ll tell me everything I don&#8217;t understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>



<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Matteo Pagani worked with Ssohrab Borhanian on testing Fisher Matrix codes (spoiler, it&#8217;s tricky).</li>



<li>William Toscani worked with Giulia Fumagalli on eccentric binary black holes, revisiting the old &#8220;isotropic stays isotropic&#8221; problem in PN dynamics.</li>



<li>Francesca Rattegni worked with Matteo &#8220;Bormio&#8221; Bonetti on how the Galaxy can cause Kozai-Lidov oscillations on wide binaries.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>

<p>Daria Gangardt has just defended her PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham. The thesis is called <em>&#8220;Black-hole dynamics and their environments&#8221;</em> and jumps from black-hole spins all the way to AGN discs. Daria, it has been a true pleasure working with you, all the way since your very first summer project and through your supervisor changing countries. I&#8217;m both honored and proud that you completed your PhD with me, all the best with everything. Time for drinks now! Go Dr. Daria! </p>

<p>Three more students graduated in March with research projects completed in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/">group</a>!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Alessandro Pedrotti defended his MSc thesis working with Michele Mancarella on gravitational-wave cosmology going from crazy calculations to fun correlations and all the way to Einstein Telescope! Alessandro is now moving on with his career with a research placement at the University of Aix-Marseille. Congrats! </li>



<li>Annalisa Amigoni completed a BSc project with Ssohrab: more fun with 3g detectors&#8230;</li>



<li>Alice Palladino also completed a BSc project; she worked with Viola and me on a strange and mind-twisting &#8220;ordering&#8221; problem using the LIGO posterior (how many times did we get confused on this!)</li>

<p>Our student Lisa Merlo defended her BSc 3rd year project today! Lisa worked with Pippa Cole and me on computing rates for mergers of primordial black holes, also considering a new detector prototype that the experimental group here is developing (nickname <a href="https://bicoq.fisica.unimib.it/">BAUSCIA</a>, from the Milan dialect). Short answer: the rate is low but now is more accurately low. Lisa&#8217;s presentation was amazing and working with her has been a real pleasure. Stay tuned for her future astro career!</p>

<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three of our BSc students graduated today. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ludovica Carbone worked with Michele Mancarella and Francesco Iacovellie and has some nice forecasts for 3G detectors.</li>



<li>Riccardo Bosoni de Martini was supervised by Costantino Pacilio and checked super carefully their Fisher code for ringdowns.</li>



<li>Malvina Bellotti (who, I&#8217;m very envious, is from Cortina in the mountains!) worked with me on selection effects for GW surveys. </li>
</ul>



<p>And, last but not least, let me add Simone Piscitelli, who last week defended his MSc degree at Milano Statale (&#8220;the other&#8221; University of Milan) supervised by Costantino Pacilio and myself. Simone worked on a cool test of GR. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>



<p>Congrats all!</p>
