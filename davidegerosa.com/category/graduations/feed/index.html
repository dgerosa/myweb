<p>Usually my students graduate in Physics, but not this time&#8230; Together with <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matteo Boschini</a>, I had the pleasure of supervising a student majoring in Computer Science. Alessandro Crespi got his BSc degree with a project on Simulation Design, which is really a computing thing but has lots of physics applications. That was so much fun! It is truly true that putting different expertise/approaches/ideas makes things better. </p>

<p>Daria Gangardt has just defended her PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham. The thesis is called <em>&#8220;Black-hole dynamics and their environments&#8221;</em> and jumps from black-hole spins all the way to AGN discs. Daria, it has been a true pleasure working with you, all the way since your very first summer project and through your supervisor changing countries. I&#8217;m both honored and proud that you completed your PhD with me, all the best with everything. Time for drinks now! Go Dr. Daria! </p>

<p>Three more students graduated in March with research projects completed in ourÂ <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/">group</a>!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Pedrotti defended his MSc thesis working with Michele Mancarella on gravitational-wave cosmology going from crazy calculations to fun correlations and all the way to Einstein Telescope! Alessandro is now moving on with his career with a research placement at the University of Aix-Marseille. Congrats! </li>



<li>Annalisa Amigoni completed a BSc project with Ssohrab: more fun with 3g detectors&#8230;</li>



<li>Alice Palladino also completed a BSc project; she worked with Viola and me on a strange and mind-twisting &#8220;ordering&#8221; problem using the LIGO posterior (how many times did we get confused on this!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our student Lisa Merlo defended her BSc 3rd year project today! Lisa worked with Pippa Cole and me on computing rates for mergers of primordial black holes, also considering a new detector prototype that the experimental group here is developing (nickname <a href="https://bicoq.fisica.unimib.it/">BAUSCIA</a>, from the Milan dialect). Short answer: the rate is low but now is more accurately low. Lisa&#8217;s presentation was amazing and working with her has been a real pleasure. Stay tuned for her future astro career!</p>

<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three of our BSc students graduated today. </p>



<ul>
<li>Ludovica Carbone worked with Michele Mancarella and Francesco Iacovellie and has some nice forecasts for 3G detectors.</li>



<li>Riccardo Bosoni de Martini was supervised by Costantino Pacilio and checked super carefully their Fisher code for ringdowns.</li>



<li>Malvina Bellotti (who, I&#8217;m very envious, is from Cortina in the mountains!) worked with me on selection effects for GW surveys. </li>
</ul>



<p>And, last but not least, let me add Simone Piscitelli, who last week defended his MSc degree at Milano Statale (&#8220;the other&#8221; University of Milan) supervised by Costantino Pacilio and myself. Simone worked on a cool test of GR. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>



<p>Congrats all!</p>

<p>Please let me introduce Dr Matthew Mould&#8230; After N papers (where N is a lot) and a 4h+15min viva discussion, Matt has completed his PhD in gravitational-wave astronomy at the University of Birmingham. WooooO! The examiners were Annelies Mortier from Birmingham and Uli Sperhake from Cambridge, who went through a thesis with more than 600 references&#8230;. Matt will be continuing his already successful career with a postdoc at MIT, LIGO lab. From my side, Matt is (actually, was!) my first PhD student and spending 3+ years working with him has been amazing. Thanks, Matt for teaching me Bayesian stats and never letting go when I was saying crap. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated. </p>



<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>
