<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered his friends call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230;and we&#8217;re back to testing GR. We&#8217;ve got many gravitational-wave events and would like to use them <em>all together</em> to figure out if our equations for gravity are correct. And here is the issue: there&#8217;s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we&#8217;ve observed. Now that&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I&#8217;m not a language guy but indeed &#8220;Universe&#8221; means like <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe">&#8220;the whole thing&#8221;</a>). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it &#8220;the cosmic variance of testing GR&#8221;.  It&#8217;s bad, but the <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html">Baron Munchauseen</a> tells us we can bootstrap. </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will join the group of Prof. Davide Gerosa and will be part of the “GWmining” project funded by the European Research Council, with additional support from national grants. Targeted investigations focus on the astrophysical exploitation of gravitational-wave data. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in population-synthesis simulations of compact binaries, gravitational-wave parameter estimation and population studies, as well as applications of statistical and machine-learning tools to gravity (although we are open to all candidates with a strong gravitational-wave and/or high-energy astrophysics background!). Candidates will have ample opportunities to kickstart new projects with group members and will be strongly encouraged to develop their own independent research lines.</p>



<p>We anticipate awarding up to three positions. Appointments will be for 2+1 years and come with a generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>



<p>The astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Observational Science Board, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), and the Italian Center for Supercomputing (ICSC). Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti. For more information on Gerosa’s group see&nbsp;<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://davidegerosa.com/group</a></p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy with history, art, and outstanding food. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in gravitational (astro)physics. Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent by November 15th, 2023 using this web form:</p>



<p><a href="https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9">https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9</a></p>



<p>Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent using the same form by November 15th, 2023.</p>



<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>Gravitational-wave data keep on giving us surprises. The most outstanding one IMO is an observed correlation between mass ratios and spins of the black holes, which was first found by Tom Callister and friends. That is so, so weird&#8230; to the point that virtually zero astrophysical models so far can explain it fully and consistently. Well, we can&#8217;t either (at least not fully and consistently) but we think this paper is a nice attempt. The secret seems to be the symmetry of the astrophysical environment one considers, and  data tends to prefer black holes assembled in cylindrical symmetry. That&#8217;s also weird to be honest, but there&#8217;s a candidate for this setup, namely accretion disks and their migration traps. Who knows, more data will tell. </p>



<p>&#8230; and huge congrats to my MSc student Alessandro who managed to publish a paper even before graduating!</p>

<p>Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Gravitational-wave populations: what&#8217;s next?</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s been a blast! </p>



<p>An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question &#8220;<em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?</em>&#8221; and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive. </p>



<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise I&#8217;ll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view. </p>



<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize. </p>



<p>And if you couldn&#8217;t make it for whatever reason no worries, we&#8217;ll do it again!</p>

<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.</strong> These are our discussion sessions</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Intro: the pieces of the population problem.</em></li>



<li><em>What can/should astrophysicists and pop-synthers predict?</em></li>



<li><em>What is the predictive power of pop-synth codes? Are we learning more than our assumptions?</em></li>



<li><em>Hierarchical Bayesian fits: can we keep on doing this? Technical difficulties, scaling with the number of events, selection effects.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the outliers. Are they in or out of your fit? If you fit something well you also need to fit the rest.</em></li>



<li><em>What is a catalog? Is p_astro the way to go? (Ir)relevance of subthreshold events.</em></li>



<li><em>Mind the systematics. Are waveform/calibration impacting the population? And how about the assumed population?</em></li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;non-parametric&#8221; methods. What are they and what does it even mean</em>.</li>



<li><em>Beyond functional forms: &#8220;parametric but informed&#8221;. Machine learning emulators for pop-synth.</em></li>



<li><em>More populations. LISA, X-ray binaries, Gaia, you name it.</em></li>



<li><em>More than individual mergers. Stochastic backgrounds, foreground removal.</em></li>



<li><em>Adding the redshift dimension: toward 3g! Use the population to do cosmology.</em></li>



<li><em>What&#8217;s next? Summary and prospects.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>New paper from a new student! Here is Matteo Boschini&#8217;s first piece of work, where we look at predictions for the final mass and spins of black-hole remnants. That is, after two black hole merge, what&#8217;s the mass and spin of the guy they left behind? These predictions are typically done by fitting (in various ways) outputs from numerical-relativity simulations but those, unfortunately, can only handle black holes of similar masses. On the other hand, black holes with masses that are very different from each other can be handled analytically. Here we show how to put the two together with a single machine-learning fit. </p>
