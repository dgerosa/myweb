<p>Welcome to the beautiful world of SBI, with this terrific piece of work by Pippa Cole. Here we&#8217;re looking at extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), that is, a small black hole orbiting a big black hole, which will be (one day) detected by LISA. These signals are nasty (long and of a very complicated morphology). We&#8217;re trying something new here &#8211; a deep learning called &#8220;truncated marginal neural ratio estimation&#8221; that does not even require writing down the likelihood of the problem. Just simulate all you can. The answer, this thing is <em>great</em> for narrowing down the parameter space where EMRIs will be, kind of like searches do with current gravitational-wave data, but in a very different way.  </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) invites applications for a tenure-track professorship in Astrophysics.</p>



<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.</p>



<p>Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.</p>



<p>The position will be at the assistant professor level (“RTT” in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.</p>



<p>Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:<br>https://www.unimib.it/ateneo/gare-e-concorsi/2025-rtt-027-dipartimento-fisica-g-occhialinigsd-02phys-05-ssd-phys-05a</p>



<p>Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>For inquiries, please contact Prof. Michele Fumagalli (michele.fumagalli@unimib.it).</p>

<p>This paper came out of some discussions from our &#8220;<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2025/01/27/gwsnowballs-was-amazing/" data-type="post" data-id="6336">Gravitational-wave snowballs</a>&#8221; workshop in Sexten (Italy). We were discussing the good old problem of separating black-hole binary formation channels with spin measurements. Usually one says &#8220;aligned=isolated&#8221;, &#8220;isotropic=dynamical&#8221;. But then, some binaries that formed dynamically should also be eccentric. What we then realized is that, for those eccentric binaries and only for those, spin measurements can actually tell <em>which</em> of the dynamical channel (because there are many&#8230;) is at play.  </p>

Well, this is a hard problem! It&#8217;s not even clear which mode is the stronger one anymore, and finding suitable coordinates is not at all trivial. While this is just a first exploration, there&#8217;s so much interesting phenomenology here! Do it yourself with the <a href="https://github.com/cpacilio/postmerger">postmerger</a> package.</p>

<p>The 2017 paper&nbsp;&#8220;<strong>Are merging black holes born from stellar collapse or previous mergers?</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;that I wrote with<a href="https://pages.jh.edu/eberti2/posts/2025-frontiers-of-science-award/"> Emanuele Berti</a> was selected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icbs.cn">2025 Frontiers of Science Award</a>. These prizes are awarded by the International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS), sponsored by the City of Beijing and the Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Application (BIMSA). Every year, they select influential recent papers in Physics, Maths, and Computer Science. </p>



<p>The complete list of Physics papers selected for awards is available&nbsp;<a href="http://davidegerosa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025FSA_Physics.pdf">here</a>. Ours is one of only three papers that were selected in the category&nbsp;<em>Astrophysics and Cosmology &#8211; Theory</em>. We&#8217;ll collect the award in July at the Great Hall of the People of China in Beijing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy to see how a seemingly simple idea we had (<em>&#8220;What if LIGO&#8217;s black holes merge multiple times?&#8221;</em>) went so far! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2017/03/18/are-merging-black-holes-born-from-stellar-collapse-or-previous-mergers/" data-type="post" data-id="2128">Our paper</a>&nbsp;was published in Physical Review D in 2017, selected as an&nbsp;<em>Editor’s Suggestion</em> back then&#8230; and now got an award!</p>

<p>Great paper led by <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/03/23/three-more/" data-type="post" data-id="5876">our former MSc student</a> Alessandro today! This is about combining the distributions of gravitational waves and galaxies to do cosmology. These two probes measure different things (distance and redshift, respectively), so their distributions will &#8220;match&#8221; only if the cosmological model is right. You can actually use this to <em>measure</em> the cosmological model itself. Short answer: putting together 3G detectors and Euclid is a great idea. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a PhD in gravitational-wave physics, our 2025 call for PhD scholarships is now available. The procedure is described here (Session 1):</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.  </p>



<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>&#8220;Guide to filling in the online application.&#8221;</em> There&#8217;s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you&#8217;re interested in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3. </p>



<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you&#8217;ve done already. Hope this helps!</p>



<p>For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me: <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m on the hook for teaching this semester (can&#8217;t complain really with such fun classes!). I&#8217;m down for &#8220;Astrostatistics and Machine Learning&#8221; for our MSc degree in Astrophysics and &#8220;Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy&#8221; for our BSc degree in Artificial Intelligence. Here is my material for both, and thanks to all the students who will be engaging with this!</p>
