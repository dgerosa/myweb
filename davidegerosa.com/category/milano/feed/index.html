<p>In 2024&#8230;. We welcomed Tristan, Chiara, Caroline, Rodrigo, Alex, Federico, and Zachos (group accretion at the Eddington limit). Michele started a faculty in Marseille, Daria graduated, Viola almost graduated and is fighting the paperwork in Marseille, Giulia went to Cambridge, Alice went to the AEI, Cecilia went to Nottingham, Costantino went to Novara. Ringdowns, EMRIs, stochastic backgrounds, p_det, catastrophes, SBI, and 3G detectors don&#8217;t have secrets for us. I think 13 BSc and 3 MSc students defended their projects with us, not sure. Arianna and Nick are two Giovani Talenti, Alex is a Young Researcher. We went to the lake together, got risotto together, and organized a conference named after Inter&#8217;s striker. If you don&#8217;t know what to eat for dinner, define a likelihood and sample it (Loutrel et al. 2024). Or put pins on google maps (Borhanian et al. 2024). You look at data, I look at the physics (Bruel et al. 2024). <br></p>

<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>

<p>Our &#8220;popfisher&#8221; paper is finally out! (and now Viola can submit her PhD thesis). This is about next-generation (aka 3G) gravitational wave detectors. Those beasts will measure millions of black holes&#8230; and with so many of them who cares about each source individually. The important thing will be the population of objects, i.e. how those black holes are distributed as a whole. Measuring populations is an interesting but convoluted statistical problem. Here we implement a quick shortcut (the Fisher matrix) and show that yes, 3G detectors will be amazing&#8230; but more amazing for some things than for others.</p>

<p>Four BSc students and one MSc student defended their research project with us this month. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, huge congrats to Federica Tettoni who got her MSc degree in astrophysics. She worked with Viola De Renzis and myself on labeling black holes in gravitational wave events. Such a fun problem (and we got confused so many times!), more <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/13/which-is-which-identification-of-the-two-compact-objects-in-gravitational-wave-binaries/" data-type="post" data-id="6130">here</a>.</li>



<li>Rocco Giugni (BSc) worked with Matteo Boschini on finding issues in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/07/10/extending-black-hole-remnant-surrogate-models-to-extreme-mass-ratios/" data-type="post" data-id="5426">his remnant surrogate models</a>&#8230;</li>



<li>Giulia Foroni (BSc) worked with me on black-hole binary spin precession. The good old problem of the spin morphologies, but this time looking for two transitions at the same time.</li>



<li>Matilde Vergani (BSc) also worked with me; we looked at merger trees and their combinatorics problem (her presentation pictures of trees, I mean actual trees&#8230;).</li>



<li>Laura Tassoni (BSc) worked with Costantino Pacilio on ringdown data analysis. </li>
</ul>



<p>Thanks all for spending some time in our research group!</p>

<p>LISA will see a gazillion white dwarfs, but we won&#8217;t, or at least not individually. Those signals will actually pile up together in a mashed potato thing called foreground. But this mashed potato won&#8217;t be smooth (translate: the gravitational-wave signal won&#8217;t be stationary and Gaussian) and this structure can indeed be precious for extracting more information from LISA. But first, let&#8217;s taste this with today&#8217;s paper, i.e. characterize the foreground.</p>
