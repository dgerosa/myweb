<p>We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>. Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:</p>



<ul>
<li>Matteo Falcone worked with the other Matteo (Boschini) on a simulation design strategy for machine learning;</li>



<li>Serena Caslini worked with Nick on a new strategy to classify burst GW signals;</li>



<li>Marco &#8220;104&#8221; Bianchi worked with Giulia and put together a neural network for black-hole binary spin precession using his gaming GPU <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Martin &#8220;Top&#8221; Gerini was supervised by Alice on supermassive black holes, LISA, and glitches.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had four amazing research students graduating with us in October!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Santini defended his MSc project, which was actually completed in part at Johns Hopkins University (USA) with R. Cotesta and E. Berti. Alessandro worked our a possible astrophysical model to explain the mass-spin correlation observed by LIGO. <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/08/28/black-hole-mergers-in-disk-like-environments-could-explain-the-observed-%f0%9d%91%9e%e2%88%92%f0%9d%9c%92eff-correlation/" data-type="post" data-id="5505">We&#8217;ve published this already</a>! Alessandro is moving on with a PhD at the AEI in Potsdam, Germany.</li>



<li>Francesco Nobili also got his MSc degree. His project was completed with S. Baghwat at the University of Birmingham as is about fitting ringdown amplitudes. I discovered other students call him &#8220;Brock&#8221; from the Pokemon character, so I started doing the same&#8230; Brock is starting a PhD in computational astrophysics at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy.</li>



<li>Federico Ravelli. Completed a shorter BSc project with Viola De Renzis on spin effects in LIGO/Virgo data&#8230;</li>



<li>&#8230; and Simone Sferlazzo also got his Physics BSc degree. Simone worked with Michele Mancarella on &#8220;the use and abuse&#8221; (cit.) of Fisher matrices in GWs.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230;and we&#8217;re back to testing GR. We&#8217;ve got many gravitational-wave events and would like to use them <em>all together</em> to figure out if our equations for gravity are correct. And here is the issue: there&#8217;s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we&#8217;ve observed. Now that&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I&#8217;m not a language guy but indeed &#8220;Universe&#8221; means like <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe">&#8220;the whole thing&#8221;</a>). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it &#8220;the cosmic variance of testing GR&#8221;.  It&#8217;s bad, but the <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html">Baron Munchauseen</a> tells us we can bootstrap. </p>

<p>Three of our BSc students graduated today. </p>



<ul>
<li>Ludovica Carbone worked with Michele Mancarella and Francesco Iacovellie and has some nice forecasts for 3G detectors.</li>



<li>Riccardo Bosoni de Martini was supervised by Costantino Pacilio and checked super carefully their Fisher code for ringdowns.</li>



<li>Malvina Bellotti (who, I&#8217;m very envious, is from Cortina in the mountains!) worked with me on selection effects for GW surveys. </li>
</ul>



<p>And, last but not least, let me add Simone Piscitelli, who last week defended his MSc degree at Milano Statale (&#8220;the other&#8221; University of Milan) supervised by Costantino Pacilio and myself. Simone worked on a cool test of GR. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>



<p>Congrats all!</p>
