<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for Ph.D. scholarships. The application deadline is May 20th, 2022 for positions starting in the Fall of 2022:</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for strong, highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. The candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of &#8220;open&#8221; scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default.&nbsp; In addition, our group sponsors two specific positions:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;Gravitational-wave data and black-hole binary dynamics&#8221;, supervised by Gerosa. Possible research directions include&nbsp;statistical inference from LIGO/Virgo and LISA data, application of machine-learning tools to gravitational-wave astronomy, and theoretical investigations of black-hole binaries.</li><li>&#8220;Dynamics of massive black hole binaries in dense stellar systems&#8221;, supervised by Sesana and Gualandris. This is a dual-doctorate position in partnership with the University of Surrey, UK.&nbsp;The main focus is the understanding of binary evolution using N-body simulations and analytical modeling. The successful candidate will spend 50% of their time at Bicocca and 50%&nbsp;of their time at Surrey.</li></ul>



<p>Candidates wishing to be considered for these additional positions should mention it explicitly in their application.</p>



<p>More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://astro.fisica.unimib.it/" target="_blank">astro.fisica.unimib.it</a>. For informal inquiries please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:alberto.sesana@unimib.it" target="_blank">alberto.sesana@unimib.it</a>.</p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for a 3+2 year research position in HPC applications to astrophysics.</p>



<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, galactic dynamics, and numerical relativity. This is embedded in a wider astronomical context including both observational and experimental activities. Our group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Science Board, the European Pulsar Timing Array, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Staff members with matching interests include Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Lupi, and Sesana.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner. Art, culture, and food are outstanding. The city hosts three international airports with worldwide connections.</p>



<p>This recruitment campaign is part of a wider national initiative supporting HPC-related computational activities throughout the country. This is a major investment program directly supported by the European Union. It will provide the most ideal context for ambitious candidates wishing to develop and apply state-of-the-art computational and machine-learning tools to current astrophysical and gravitational-wave modeling issues.</p>



<p>The researcher will be appointed at the so-called &#8220;RTDA&#8221; level for 3 years. The contract can also be extended for 2 more years depending on funding availability.&nbsp; The starting date is negotiable, with the earliest and latest dates on January 1st, 2023 and May 1st, 2023, respectively. RTDA researchers are full-time university employees (with full benefits, such as health insurance and pension plan), have limited teaching duties, and are eligible to fully supervise research MSc student projects. This is an ideal setup for early-career researchers wishing to transition toward research independence and start developing their own group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The successful candidate will have a PhD in Physics, Astronomy, Computer Science, or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: HPC workflows, GPU software development, computational astrophysics, gravitational-wave astronomy, numerical relativity, statistical data analysis, machine learning.</p>



<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for two reference letters to be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups. Women are especially encouraged to apply. For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Bruno Giacomazzo (<a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a>) or Davide Gerosa (<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>).</p>

<p>Observing gravitational waves from the ground (i.e. LIGO, Virgo, etc) give us a unique view on &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9208005" target="_blank">the last three minutes</a>&#8221; of the life of compact objects before they merge with each other. Going to space (I&#8217;m talking to you, LISA!) will instead give us &#8220;the last three years&#8221;. Completed together with the rest of the Birmingham crowd, this paper provides a realistic view of this truly amazing landscape. LISA observations at low frequencies in the 2030s will be paired with high-frequency data from LIGO&#8217;s successors (the so-called 3rd generation detectors). Together (and that&#8217;s crucial, together!) LISA and 3g detectors will tell us the full story of the life of merging black holes. LIGO alone is like catching up with a movie because you were late at the theatre, LISA alone is like a huge cliffhanger before the series finale&#8230; multiband observations are a bingewatching experience!</p>

<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guys&#8230; our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but we&#8217;re interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism." target="_blank">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called &#8220;sequential prior conditioning&#8221; (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian stats&#8230;). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow. </p>

<p>It took a while (so many technical challenges&#8230;) but we made it! <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">Matt</a>&#8216;s monster paper is finally out! </p>



<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but it&#8217;s not: it&#8217;s necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we don&#8217;t do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), there&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Matt&#8217;s paper.</p>
