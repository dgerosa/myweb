<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will join the group of Prof. Davide Gerosa and will be part of the “GWmining” project funded by the European Research Council. Targeted investigations focus on the astrophysical exploitation of gravitational-wave data. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in population-synthesis simulations of compact binaries, gravitational-wave parameter estimation and population studies, and numerical-relativity surrogate modeling (although we are open to all candidates with a strong gravitational-wave and/or high-energy astrophysics background!). Candidates will have ample opportunities to collaborate and kickstart new projects with group members and will be strongly encouraged to develop their own independent collaborations.</p>



<p>We anticipate awarding up to three positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>



<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Observational Science Board, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), and the newly formed Italian Center for Supercomputing (ICSC). Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti. For more information on Gerosa&#8217;s group see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/group" target="_blank">https://davidegerosa.com/group&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy with history, art, and outstanding food. Mountains lakes are just around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in gravitational (astro)physics. Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent by November 18th, 2022 using this web form:</p>



<p><a href="https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9">https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9</a></p>



<p>Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent using the same form by November 18th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it" rel="noreferrer noopener">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I&#8217;m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots&#8230;). All the best for what comes next!</p>

<p>The Italian government has pushed a hiring program dedicated to holders and applicants of Marie Curie Fellowships from the EU. The call targets those that have either (i) completed a successful Marie Curie Fellowship in the past 4 years or (ii) applied unsuccessfully in the past 4 years but were awarded the so-called &#8220;Seal of Excellence&#8221;. </p>



<p>For both categories, successful&nbsp;candidates will be awarded a 3yr senior researcher position (at the so-called RTDA level in the Italian system). RTDAs are hired as full employees with related benefits and have limited teaching duties. On top of this, candidates in the&nbsp;Marie Curie winners strand (i) will&nbsp;also be offered a substantial startup grant to hire their own PhD&nbsp;students and postdocs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All Italian institutions can act as hosts, so I encourage you to contact one of us in the country for more&nbsp;information.</p>



<p>In particular, the gravitational-wave group at the University of Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with activities ranging from relativistic astrophysics. gravitational-wave data analysis, numerical relativity, and gravity theory. The group counts faculty members Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti as well as tens of students and postdocs. The city of Milan is a jewel in the north of Italy with a charming international vibe (as well as mountains, history, art, and outstanding food).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The internal application deadline is October 18th. If you&#8217;re eligible and/or interested in applying with us, please get in touch asap (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it" target="_blank">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>) and we&#8217;ll go from there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lots of &#8220;firsts&#8221; today! My <em>first</em>-year PhD student Viola just put out her <em>first</em> <em>first</em>-author paper. This is about measuring black holes with not one, but two precessing spins. People have been trying to figure out how to tell if at least one of the two spins of a merging black-hole binary is precessing for quite some time now. And maybe we&#8217;ve even done it already for one or two of the current LIGO-Virgo events. But here I must quote that epic Italian  commercial from the 90s: &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDHcjEH2syA&amp;ab_channel=PinguinoMagazine" target="_blank">two gust is megl che one</a>&#8221; (which is a terrible Italian-English mishmash on a terrible joke  to say that when you eat a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxibon" target="_blank">Maxibon</a> &#8220;two flavors are better than one&#8221;). In this paper we propose a strategy to identify sources that have the strongest evidence of two processing spins. Viola has been putting together simulated data for the next LIGO/Virgo data-taking period, and the result is pretty cool. If these binaries are out there in the Universe, we will be able to tell they have two spins going around! </p>

<p>Big stars burn everything they have, die fast, and produce big black holes. So when you see two black holes together, it&#8217;s likely that the big black hole comes from the big star. Or maybe not? Before dying, the big star can drop some mass onto the other guy, making it bigger! So now, the initially big star still produces the first black hole, but, at the end of the day, that might not be the more massive black hole anymore! This scenario is called &#8220;mass-ratio reversal&#8221; and our astrophysics friends have put together many models out there showing this is indeed possible for a good fraction of the black holes that produce gravitational-wave events. So here we ask the data: given the events LIGO and Virgo have seen so far, what&#8217;s the evidence for mass-ratio reversal in binary stars? Read Matt&#8217;s paper to find out.</p>
