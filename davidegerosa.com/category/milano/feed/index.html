<p>Huge congrats to two of my students who graduated today! Matteo Muriano completed a funny BSc project on black-hole merger trees. And Giovanni Cavallotto went all in for his MSc research: he basically  &#8220;fixed&#8221; black-hole binary spin precession at 2PN! (which is pretty cool, stay tuned for these results!). They both defended quite brilliantly, good luck with everything now! </p>

<p>We want more! With gravitational-wave data, some quantities like the masses of the black holes are much easier to see than others. But those others are very interesting, notably spins that process and orbits that are eccentric, because they would tell us how black hole binaries came to be in the first place. So while it would be great to see those, it&#8217;s also being very hard. Some tentative claims have been made with current data, but nothing unambiguous so far. In this paper led by Isobel from Cambridge, we show that (surprise surprise&#8230;) the signals needs to be long enough before one can tell eccentricity and spin precession apart.</p>

<p>Together with my postdoc Nate, we&#8217;re proceeding our investigations on supermassive, spinning binary black holes surrounded by accretion disks (that is: a ton of gas around big monsters at the center of galaxies!). In today&#8217;s paper, we dig a bit deeper into what happens when the disk breaks. That presumably stops the interactions between the gas and the black-hole spins which could make all this funky astrophysics (spins that moves, disks that breaks, etc) actually <em>observable</em> with future gravitational-wave detectors. More needs to be done of course, but here we are.</p>

<p>More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work.  Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries, Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. It&#8217;s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science&#8230; I think it&#8217;s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I&#8217;ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me). </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>



<p>Successful candidates will join the group of Prof. Davide Gerosa and will be part of the “GWmining” project funded by the European Research Council. Targeted investigations focus on the astrophysical exploitation of gravitational-wave data. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in population-synthesis simulations of compact binaries, gravitational-wave parameter estimation and population studies, and numerical-relativity surrogate modeling (although we are open to all candidates with a strong gravitational-wave and/or high-energy astrophysics background!). Candidates will have ample opportunities to collaborate and kickstart new projects with group members and will be strongly encouraged to develop their own independent collaborations.</p>



<p>We anticipate awarding up to three positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>



<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Observational Science Board, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), and the newly formed Italian Center for Supercomputing (ICSC). Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti. For more information on Gerosa&#8217;s group see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://davidegerosa.com/group" target="_blank">https://davidegerosa.com/group&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy with history, art, and outstanding food. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in gravitational (astro)physics. Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent by November 18th, 2022 using this web form:</p>



<p><a href="https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9">https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9</a></p>



<p>Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent using the same form by November 18th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it" rel="noreferrer noopener">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I&#8217;m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots&#8230;). All the best for what comes next!</p>

<p>The Italian government has pushed a hiring program dedicated to holders and applicants of Marie Curie Fellowships from the EU. The call targets those that have either (i) completed a successful Marie Curie Fellowship in the past 4 years or (ii) applied unsuccessfully in the past 4 years but were awarded the so-called &#8220;Seal of Excellence&#8221;. </p>



<p>For both categories, successful&nbsp;candidates will be awarded a 3yr senior researcher position (at the so-called RTDA level in the Italian system). RTDAs are hired as full employees with related benefits and have limited teaching duties. On top of this, candidates in the&nbsp;Marie Curie winners strand (i) will&nbsp;also be offered a substantial startup grant to hire their own PhD&nbsp;students and postdocs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All Italian institutions can act as hosts, so I encourage you to contact one of us in the country for more&nbsp;information.</p>



<p>In particular, the gravitational-wave group at the University of Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with activities ranging from relativistic astrophysics. gravitational-wave data analysis, numerical relativity, and gravity theory. The group counts faculty members Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti as well as tens of students and postdocs. The city of Milan is a jewel in the north of Italy with a charming international vibe (as well as mountains, history, art, and outstanding food).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The internal application deadline is October 18th. If you&#8217;re eligible and/or interested in applying with us, please get in touch asap (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it" target="_blank">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>) and we&#8217;ll go from there.</p>
