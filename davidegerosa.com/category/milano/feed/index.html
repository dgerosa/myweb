<p>The Italian Society of General Relativity and Gravitation (SIGRAV) announces the 26th SIGRAV Conference, hosted by the University of Milano-Bicocca, to be held in Milan, Italy, from September 8-12, 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025</a></p>



<p>The conference will cover various aspects of classical and quantum gravity, including tests of General Relativity, cosmology, gravity experiments, and gravitational waves from experimental, theoretical, and data-analysis perspectives.</p>



<p>Participation is open to SIGRAV members and non-members alike, both nationally and internationally. The program will feature a series of broad review talks on various aspects of gravitational physics, as well as contributed talks. The SIGRAV Amaldi medals, the SIGRAV prizes for young researchers, and the Giulio Rampa PhD thesis prize will be awarded during the conference. There will also be a public event dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914.</p>



<p>Abstracts for contributed talks should submitted by May 31, 2025. We aim to announce the full conference program by the end of June. Registrations will be accepted until July 15, 2025.</p>



<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; you can also explore nearby lakes or venture into the stunning Alps.</p>

<p>When inferring black holes from gravitational-wave data, we tend to do two things, one after the other. First, we consider each event individually and measure its parameters (masses, spins, etc). Then we consider all the events together and measure the population properties. This is what we do all the time, but, actually, if objects are now part of a population, those parameters should be looked at again in light of all the others. This full problem (all parameters of all the events plus the population parameters) is daunting, and <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2021/08/06/population-informed-priors-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy/" data-type="post" data-id="4498">in the past</a> we used an indirect and somewhat convoluted approach. We got back to it now, and this time, we managed to do it head-on. Let me introduce this giant 500-dimensional sampling of the full population problem! </p>

<p>Long gravitational-was signals are, well, long. And long often means painful, as more data need to be stored and processed. Kind of intuitively, the solution might be that of cutting things into chunks, so that long becomes short. Here we apply this idea to the popular inner product entering all gravitational-wave pipelines; this is a key building block of everything we do. The answer is that using SFTs, &#8220;Short-time Fourier Transforms&#8221;, can make things faster by more than 3 orders of magnitudes, sometimes 5. We think this is <em>the</em> solution to future gravitational-wave data analysis problems (think LISA and 3G&#8230;).</p>

<p>General relativity has this beautiful property that coordinates are meaningless. You can change them at will, which means they don&#8217;t contain any physics. And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but that&#8217;s killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself. The paper is on the maths-heavy side of things, but the results are great. Peters, you were basically right, but not quite.</p>

When our paper hit the arxiv, we got contacted by the real astronomers who take actual data, who told us they had even more beautiful data. We ended up contributing with our relativistic model and&#8230; well&#8230; everything seems to work. 3C 186 is indeed a recoiling black hole (it might be a rare one, but we&#8217;ve observed it nonetheless). The abstract says &#8220;decisive,&#8221; and this is indeed the right word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gravitational-wave population people talk all the time about parametric vs non-parametric methods. Parametric methods mean imposing our astrophysical knowledge on how we look at GW data. This is great, we do want to extract astrophysical knowledge, but what if we don&#8217;t know what to look for? The statisticians tell us to go non-parametric, which means using a flexible model that can fit whatever you want. That&#8217;s great, but what do we learn then? In other words, where&#8217;s the boundary between flexibility and interpretability? Today&#8217;s paper shows that one can conceptually separate these two processes and extract parametric results from non-parametric fits. I&#8217;m very proud of this piece of work, which was <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/20/cecilia-et-al/" data-type="post" data-id="6143">Cecilia Fabbri</a>&#8216;s MSc thesis project and was actually kickstarted by one of my previous students, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/10/28/2-msc-2-bsc/" data-type="post" data-id="5623">Alessandro Santini</a>. We even wrote <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">a poem</a> about this!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so so proud to see my PhD student Viola De Renzis defending her PhD thesis today. Viola&#8217;s thesis is titled <em>&#8220;Gravitational-wave astronomy at the crossroads: from current to future detectors, from single events to populations&#8221;</em> and was examined by Maya Fishbach (Toronto), Laura Sberna (Nottingham) as external referees, as well as Walter Del Pozzo (Pisa), Stephen Green (Nottingham) and Alberto Sesana (Milano-Bicocca) as defense committee members. What should I say, from the first &#8220;off you go and learn Bilby&#8221; meeting we had, to all those discussions at the board, learning how to ski, those codes that did (not) work, and that distinctive laughter across the corridor. Our group will not be the same without Viola. You turned into a great scientist: now &#8220;spacca tutti&#8221; in Marseille!</p>
