Alessandro Crespi got his BSc degree with a project on Simulation Design, which is really a computing thing but has lots of physics applications. That was so much fun! It is truly true that putting different expertise/approaches/ideas makes things better. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>&#8230; and we&#8217;re <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/07/15/gravitational-wave-selection-effects-using-neural-network-classifiers/" data-type="post" data-id="3542">back to</a> selection effects. That means modeling what you cannot see. The black holes that gravitational-wave detectors observe are not representative of those that are out there in the Universe. Some are easier to see, some are harder. Quantifying how much easier and harder is crucial to properly understand the underlying astrophysics. In this paper (which came <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/09/20/students-going-for-3g-ringdowns-and-selection-effects/" data-type="post" data-id="5605">out of a BSc student project</a>!), we go back to the basics and work out gravitational-wave selection effects one step after the other, using and refining the most common approximation. Two things to remember: including noise fluctuations is easy, and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 11 is probably ok. </p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. This year&#8217;s application deadline is May 14th, 2024 (noon CEST) for positions starting in the Fall of 2024:</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>In particular, we are looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics and gravitational-wave data exploitation. Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational-wave physics, covering activities ranging from astrophysical/numerical modeling to data analysis. The group counts 7 faculty members (Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Sesana, and an upcoming new hire) together with several postdocs (of which two prize fellows) and PhD students. Candidates will also have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators.</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes several “open” scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, we are advertising an additional “project” scholarship titled “Gravitational-wave source modeling” which will be supervised by Prof. Davide Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.8). For more information on Gerosa&#8217;s group see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group">www.davidegerosa.com/group</a></p>



<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. For informal inquiries, expressions of interest, and application tips please do not hesitate to contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>Three more students graduated in March with research projects completed in our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/">group</a>!</p>



<ul>
<li>Alessandro Pedrotti defended his MSc thesis working with Michele Mancarella on gravitational-wave cosmology going from crazy calculations to fun correlations and all the way to Einstein Telescope! Alessandro is now moving on with his career with a research placement at the University of Aix-Marseille. Congrats! </li>



<li>Annalisa Amigoni completed a BSc project with Ssohrab: more fun with 3g detectors&#8230;</li>



<li>Alice Palladino also completed a BSc project; she worked with Viola and me on a strange and mind-twisting &#8220;ordering&#8221; problem using the LIGO posterior (how many times did we get confused on this!)</li>
