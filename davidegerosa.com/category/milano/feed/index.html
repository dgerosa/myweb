<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>

<p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. The application deadline is April 19th, 2023 for positions starting in the Fall of 2023:</p>



<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>



<p>In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. Candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well.</p>



<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of &#8220;open&#8221; scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, our group this year is advertising an additional &#8220;project&#8221; scholarship titled &#8220;Gravitational-wave source modeling&#8221; and supervised by Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this additional opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.3).</p>



<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at <a href="https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">astro.fisica.unimib.it</a>. For informal inquiries and expressions of interest please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated. </p>



<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models&#8230; stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>



<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He&#8217;s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

<p>The student reps of our department (codename: <a href="https://redshiftunimib.wordpress.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redshiftunimib.wordpress.com/">redshift</a>) have organized a stellar event today. Curiosity and interest in the LISA space mission brought them to design a full day of talks from leading experts in the field. They put Stefano Vitale, Alessandra Buonanno, and Bernard Schutz in the same room with the (astro)physics students and, well, a few of us who tagged along. The result was an amazing rollercoaster called &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/eventi/lisa-and-beyond" target="_blank">LISA and beyond</a>&#8221; across the wonders of the experimental design by Stefano (is this truly going to work?!?), some amazing order-of-magnitude calculations that Bernard pulled off (wish I could do that!), and a broad vision by Alessandra across the discoveries we had and those we will soon be seeing (can&#8217;t wait, can&#8217;t wait!). Our students engaged with the speakers, asked questions, and organized a round table touching topics like the carbon footprint of space missions, gender equality, and how to manage a research group. Such ingenuity and enthusiasm are what keeps science alive! We should learn from our students and do science like that.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to announce the workshop “Gravitational-wave populations: what’s next?” which we are currently organizing for next summer:</p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext</a></p>



<p>As the catalog of detected gravitational-wave events grows from O(10) to O(100) sources (but think millions in a few decades!), such increasingly detailed information is allowing us to dig deeper into the (astro)physics of compact objects. At the same time, new and more data require appropriately powerful statistical tools to be fully exploited. This highly interactive workshop (fewer talks, more working together!) will be the opportunity to share recent progress, identify what new steps are now needed, and hopefully set the stage for substantial progress in the field.</p>



<p>The workshop will take place on July 10-14, 2023 at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which is located near the city center of Milan, Italy. Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; nearby excursions will take you to the Italian lakes and the stunning Alps.</p>



<p>While we are unable to provide travel support, the workshop will have no registration fee. The workshop will be in person without remote options.</p>



<p>Interested participants should register on the conference website by March 1st, 2023. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline, so please do not make travel plans until you hear back from us. When registering please indicate which of the discussion session(s) you would like to contribute to. Early career scientists will have the opportunity to give flash talks highlighting their science.</p>



<p>Davide Gerosa (Milano-Bicocca), Emanuele Berti (Johns Hopkins), Salvatore Vitale (MIT)</p>

<p>We want more! With gravitational-wave data, some quantities like the masses of the black holes are much easier to see than others. But those others are very interesting, notably spins that process and orbits that are eccentric, because they would tell us how black hole binaries came to be in the first place. So while it would be great to see those, it&#8217;s also being very hard. Some tentative claims have been made with current data, but nothing unambiguous so far. In this paper led by Isobel from Cambridge, we show that (surprise surprise&#8230;) the signals needs to be long enough before one can tell eccentricity and spin precession apart.</p>
