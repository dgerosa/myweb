<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>

<p>Our &#8220;popfisher&#8221; paper is finally out! (and now Viola can submit her PhD thesis). This is about next-generation (aka 3G) gravitational wave detectors. Those beasts will measure millions of black holes&#8230; and with so many of them who cares about each source individually. The important thing will be the population of objects, i.e. how those black holes are distributed as a whole. Measuring populations is an interesting but convoluted statistical problem. Here we implement a quick shortcut (the Fisher matrix) and show that yes, 3G detectors will be amazing&#8230; but more amazing for some things than for others.</p>

<p>Four BSc students and one MSc student defended their research project with us this month. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, huge congrats to Federica Tettoni who got her MSc degree in astrophysics. She worked with Viola De Renzis and myself on labeling black holes in gravitational wave events. Such a fun problem (and we got confused so many times!), more <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/09/13/which-is-which-identification-of-the-two-compact-objects-in-gravitational-wave-binaries/" data-type="post" data-id="6130">here</a>.</li>



<li>Rocco Giugni (BSc) worked with Matteo Boschini on finding issues in <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2023/07/10/extending-black-hole-remnant-surrogate-models-to-extreme-mass-ratios/" data-type="post" data-id="5426">his remnant surrogate models</a>&#8230;</li>



<li>Giulia Foroni (BSc) worked with me on black-hole binary spin precession. The good old problem of the spin morphologies, but this time looking for two transitions at the same time.</li>



<li>Matilde Vergani (BSc) also worked with me; we looked at merger trees and their combinatorics problem (her presentation pictures of trees, I mean actual trees&#8230;).</li>



<li>Laura Tassoni (BSc) worked with Costantino Pacilio on ringdown data analysis. </li>
</ul>



<p>Thanks all for spending some time in our research group!</p>

<p>LISA will see a gazillion white dwarfs, but we won&#8217;t, or at least not individually. Those signals will actually pile up together in a mashed potato thing called foreground. But this mashed potato won&#8217;t be smooth (translate: the gravitational-wave signal won&#8217;t be stationary and Gaussian) and this structure can indeed be precious for extracting more information from LISA. But first, let&#8217;s taste this with today&#8217;s paper, i.e. characterize the foreground.</p>

<p>This is a fun IMBH story we worked out when Kostas and Luca <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/07/16/many-visitors/" data-type="post" data-id="6083">were visiting</a> last summer from JHU. What if (one day, who knows) we observe a highly spinning intermediate-mass black hole? If that happens, is going to be puzzling because IMBH that grow in clusters by mergers of smaller black holes tend to spin down, not up. This is a funny property of black holes, namely that extracting spins is easier than putting it in, so on average black holes slow down after they have merged many times. So if we see an IMBH with large spins, the spin must come from somewhere else. Where? Maybe gas. The argument then is that one can actually convert an IMBH spin measurement into the minimum amount of gas that must have been accreted to get that spin. </p>

<p>Four students just graduated with projects in our group&#8230; </p>



<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2022/02/23/congrats-cecilia/" data-type="post" data-id="4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/06/23/one-population-fit-to-rule-them-all/" data-type="post" data-id="6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, it&#8217;s always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit you&#8217;ll tell me everything I don&#8217;t understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>



<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Matteo Pagani worked with Ssohrab Borhanian on testing Fisher Matrix codes (spoiler, it&#8217;s tricky).</li>



<li>William Toscani worked with Giulia Fumagalli on eccentric binary black holes, revisiting the old &#8220;isotropic stays isotropic&#8221; problem in PN dynamics.</li>



<li>Francesca Rattegni worked with Matteo &#8220;Bormio&#8221; Bonetti on how the Galaxy can cause Kozai-Lidov oscillations on wide binaries.</li>
</ul>



<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>
