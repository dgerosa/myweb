										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

<p>&#8230;and we&#8217;re back to testing GR. We&#8217;ve got many gravitational-wave events and would like to use them <em>all together</em> to figure out if our equations for gravity are correct. And here is the issue: there&#8217;s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we&#8217;ve observed. Now that&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I&#8217;m not a language guy but indeed &#8220;Universe&#8221; means like <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe">&#8220;the whole thing&#8221;</a>). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it &#8220;the catalog variance of testing GR&#8221;.  It&#8217;s bad, but the <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html">Baron Munchauseen</a> tells us we can bootstrap. </p>

<p>Gravitational-wave data keep on giving us surprises. The most outstanding one IMO is an observed correlation between mass ratios and spins of the black holes, which was first found by Tom Callister and friends. That is so, so weird&#8230; to the point that virtually zero astrophysical models so far can explain it fully and consistently. Well, we can&#8217;t either (at least not fully and consistently) but we think this paper is a nice attempt. The secret seems to be the symmetry of the astrophysical environment one considers, and  data tends to prefer black holes assembled in cylindrical symmetry. That&#8217;s also weird to be honest, but there&#8217;s a candidate for this setup, namely accretion disks and their migration traps. Who knows, more data will tell. </p>



<p>&#8230; and huge congrats to my MSc student Alessandro who managed to publish a paper even before graduating!</p>

<p>New paper from a new student! Here is Matteo Boschini&#8217;s first piece of work, where we look at predictions for the final mass and spins of black-hole remnants. That is, after two black hole merge, what&#8217;s the mass and spin of the guy they left behind? These predictions are typically done by fitting (in various ways) outputs from numerical-relativity simulations but those, unfortunately, can only handle black holes of similar masses. On the other hand, black holes with masses that are very different from each other can be handled analytically. Here we show how to put the two together with a single machine-learning fit. </p>

<p>All right, this is kind of far from my day-to-day topics but working on this paper with Alice and Riccardo was super fun. Think LISA and supermassive binary black holes. And&#8230; the detector does what it wants. That&#8217;s not true of course because the experimentalists are amazing, but there will be noise transients: unexpected blips when the gravitational-wave signal will be corrupted. Here we look at what would happen in a realistic setting when a LISA glitch happens on top of a gravitational wave from a supermassive black hole. </p>

<p>This paper is episode four in the up-down instability series. We first figured out the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">episode 1</a>), then computed when binaries go after the instability (i.e. the endpoint, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">episode 2</a>), and also checked binaries are really unstable in numerical relativity (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/12/15/up-down-instability-of-binary-black-holes-in-numerical-relativity/" data-type="post" data-id="3755">episode 3</a>). Now we look at the inference problem with LIGO/Virgo: if unstable up-down binaries enter the sensitivity window of the detector, will we be able to tell? We phrased the problem with some fancy stats using the so-called Savage Dickey density ratio, which is the right tool to answer this question. As is too often the case, current data are not informative enough but the future is bright and loud.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>
