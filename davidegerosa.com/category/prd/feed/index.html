<p>Today&#8217;s paper is about superkicks. These are extreme configurations of black hole binaries which receive a large recoil. Black hole recoils work much like those of, say, a cannon. As the cannonball flies, the cannon recoils backwards. Here the binary is shooting gravitational waves: as they are emitted, the system recoils in the opposite direction. In this paper we show that superkicks might be up to 25% larger if the binary is mildly eccentric. This means it&#8217;s a bit easier to kick black holes out of stellar clusters and galaxies.</p>

<p>Gravitational-wave astronomy is, seems obvious to say, about doing astronomy with gravitational waves. One has gravitational-wave observations (thanks LIGO and Virgo!) on hand and astrophysical models on the other hand. The more closely these two sides interact, the more we  can hope to use gravitational-wave data to learn about the astrophysics of the sources. Today&#8217;s paper with JHU student Kaze Wong tries to further stimulate this dialog. And, well, one needs to throw some artificial intelligence in the game. There are three players now (astrophysics, gravitational waves, and machine learning) and things get even  more interesting.</p>

<p>Funny things happen in supernova explosions. Funny and complicated. If the star is too massive, the explosion is unstable. The black hole it formed it not as massive as it could have been. In gravitational-wave astronomy, this means that we should not observe black holes heavier than about 50 solar masses. This does not apply, of course, to black holes that are <em>not</em> formed from stars, but from other black holes (yes! more black holes!). If black holes resulting from older gravitational wave events somehow stick around, they could be recycled in other generations of mergers. We point out that this can work only if their astrophysical environment is dense enough. Can we measure the escape speed of black holes &#8220;nurseries&#8221; using gravitational-wave events that should not be there because of supernova instabilities?</p>

<p>Where do black holes come from? Sounds like a scify book title, but it&#8217;s real. These days, that&#8217;s actually the million dollar question in gravitational-wave astronomy. LIGO sees (lots of!) black holes in binaries, and those data encode information on how their stellar progenitors behave, what they like or did not like to do. This is paper is the latest attempt to understand if black holes formed alone (i.e. a single binary star forms a single binary black hole) or together (i.e. many stars exchange pairs in dense stellar environments).</p>

<p>The prospect of multiband gravitational-wave astronomy is so so so exciting (I mean, really!). So exciting that we want to make sure once again it&#8217;s true; and this is today&#8217;s paper. Multiband means seeing the same black hole binary with both LIGO at high frequencies and LISA at low frequencies. LISA observations can serve as precursors for the LIGO mergers, and you can a whole lot of new science (astrophysics, tests of GR, smart data analysis, cosmology, etc). Here we have a new semi-analytic way to estimate the rate (i.e. how many) of multiband events, and we also explore some of the stellar physics one could constraint with them. Enjoy!</p>

Suppose you have a merging binary which is emitting gravitational waves (bibooou). If that binary is going somewhere (say it&#8217;s falling into the gravitational potential of a third body), much like the ambulance, the emitted signal will be Doppler shifted. This paper shows a very nice calculation to incorporate Doppler shifts into gravitational waves.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s paper celebrates the wedding of <a href="https://www.syntheticuniverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startrack</a> and <a href="http://davidegerosa.com/precession/">precession</a> (the nickname for this project was pretrack <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). We use population synthesis evolution from startrack to predict the parameters of spinning black-hole binaries observed by LIGO. The spin distribution is then propagated from formation to detection using post-Newtonian evolutions from my precession code. The bottom line is that spin measurements can be used to truly reconstruct the binary formation channels, and some specific mechanisms (like mass transfers, tides, natal kicks, supernova&#8217;s instabilities etc.). Our <a href="http://davidegerosa.com/spops/">database</a> is publicly available (play with it!), as well as a <a href="http://davidegerosa.com/gwdet/">little code</a> to compute gravitational-wave detectabilities.</p>



<p><em>Update</em>: this is my 25th published paper! That&#8217;s silver, right?</p>

<p>LISA is going to be amazing: supermassive black-holes, galactic white dwarfs, EMRIs&#8230; Besides all of that, LISA can help us doing LIGO&#8217;s science better. Some LIGO sources (notably, things like GW150914) will show up in LISA years in advance. LISA is going to tell us when (in time) and where (in frequency) LIGO will see these sources. In this paper, we explore the idea of adapting the LIGO noise curve if one knows that a source is coming in (because LISA told us). We apply this idea to ringdown tests of GR, and show how powerful they become.</p>

<p>Gravitational-wave astronomy is moving. Quickly. In a few years we are going to have large catalogs of many detections, and a whole lot of information to extract from them. Instead of focussing on <em>parameters</em> (masses, spins, redshifts) of single sources, we will want to extract <em>hyperparameters</em> describing physical features of the population (metallicity, natal kicks, common envelope, stellar winds, etc). Here we show how to do this in practice: read our new paper for an amazing journey through hyperlateral cubes, Gaussian process emulators, selection biases, hierarchical modeling and more.</p>

<p>LIGO can measure spins. Well, effective spins actually. These are special combinations of the two spins (magnitude and direction) and the binary mass ratio. There&#8217;s a ton of astrophysics that can be done just with this quantity, but one should always be careful. Today&#8217;s paper points out a few important shortcomings when dealing with effective spin measurements. Want to know more about asymmetries and selection biases?</p>



<p><em>ps.</em> You can hardly find a better day to post a paper on the arxiv than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 4th</a></p>
