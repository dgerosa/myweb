<p>Black holes on eccentric orbits&#8230; what does it even mean? The hard (but fun) thing is that we work in General Relativity, where coordinates don&#8217;t have a physics inside. One can always change the coordinates as they want, so they can&#8217;t be used to define observables. The eccentricity of an orbit has to do, indeed, with the shape of the orbit itself, and that can be transformed away with suitable coordinates. So, does it even sense to measure the orbital eccentricity of black-hole binaries? The one thing we are allowed to do is to find a coordinate-free estimator in General Relativity that reduces to the eccentricity we all know and love in the Newtonian limit. This is possible! The right mathematical framework for this is something called &#8220;catastrophe theory&#8221;, a funny name, but Nick likes it.  </p>

<p>This is a fun IMBH story we worked out when Kostas and Luca <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2024/07/16/many-visitors/" data-type="post" data-id="6083">were visiting</a> last summer from JHU. What if (one day, who knows) we observe a highly spinning intermediate-mass black hole? If that happens, is going to be puzzling because IMBH that grow in clusters by mergers of smaller black holes tend to spin down, not up. This is a funny property of black holes, namely that extracting spins is easier than putting it in, so on average black holes slow down after they have merged many times. So if we see an IMBH with large spins, the spin must come from somewhere else. Where? Maybe gas. The argument then is that one can actually convert an IMBH spin measurement into the minimum amount of gas that must have been accreted to get that spin. </p>

<p>The ringdown is the final bit of a gravitational-wave signal, after the two black holes have merged. It&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s clean; GR is so powerful that all that comes out after a black hole merger has specific frequencies, the fantastic &#8220;quasi-normal modes.&#8221;  While the frequencies only depend on that final BH (thanks Kerr!), the excitations of those frequencies depend on all that happened before, i.e. the merger process itself. In this summer paper by Costantino and the rest of us, we present a new accurate approximant to those amplitudes. Now go home and test GR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The orbits of binary black holes <em>could</em> be eccentric, but in practice they&#8217;re not. At least when we observe them, and that&#8217;s because of a relativistic effect that circularizes the orbit. Even if astrophysics formed black holes eccentric, relativity makes them circular when we observe them with gravitational-wave interferometers. But we&#8217;re interested in the astrophysics back then! What we find here is that the tiny residual eccentricity at detection can be crucial. Even eccentricities that are so small that we cannot tell them apart from circular can mess up the astrophysical inference. Unfortunately, this is a new systematic error that needs to be taken into account: inferring the &#8220;formation channel&#8221; of binary black holes might be even harder than we thought. </p>

<p>This is the first of two papers on the arxiv today: it&#8217;s fun when two long, very different projects by different people just happen to be done on the same day! This paper is by my former colleague Nate Steinle (now a postdoc in Manitoba, Canada). Here we connect the dynamics of jets in AGN disks to the spin of black holes observable by LISA. And show the latter is a diagnostic of the former! And it&#8217;s nice to see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/04/08/the-bardeen-petterson-effect-in-accreting-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-a-systematic-approach/" data-type="post" data-id="3165">my disk-binary</a> code being used for something I didn&#8217;t think of when I wrote it.</p>

<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

And here is the issue: there&#8217;s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we&#8217;ve observed. Now that&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I&#8217;m not a language guy but indeed &#8220;Universe&#8221; means like <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe">&#8220;the whole thing&#8221;</a>). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it &#8220;the catalog variance of testing GR&#8221;.  It&#8217;s bad, but the <a href="https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html">Baron Munchauseen</a> tells us we can bootstrap. </p>

<p>Gravitational-wave data keep on giving us surprises. The most outstanding one IMO is an observed correlation between mass ratios and spins of the black holes, which was first found by Tom Callister and friends. That is so, so weird&#8230; to the point that virtually zero astrophysical models so far can explain it fully and consistently. Well, we can&#8217;t either (at least not fully and consistently) but we think this paper is a nice attempt. The secret seems to be the symmetry of the astrophysical environment one considers, and  data tends to prefer black holes assembled in cylindrical symmetry. That&#8217;s also weird to be honest, but there&#8217;s a candidate for this setup, namely accretion disks and their migration traps. Who knows, more data will tell. </p>



<p>&#8230; and huge congrats to my MSc student Alessandro who managed to publish a paper even before graduating!</p>
