<p>Great Scott, a new paper! When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together. The issue Matt and I are tackling here is that one needs to be consistent with putting together different events when fitting the entire population. This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here). In that case, it&#8217;s dangerous to put together events taken at different stages of their evolution. And the solution to this problem is&#8230;. time travel! We show that but propagating binaries backward in time, one can put all sources on the same footing. After that, estimating the impact of the detector requires traveling forward in time, so going &#8220;back to the future&#8221;. After all, we all know that post-Newtonian black-hole binary integrations look like this:</p>

<p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka &#8220;parameter estimation&#8221;), all of them together (aka &#8220;population&#8221;), or each of them individually while they&#8217;re together. That&#8217;s what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, don&#8217;t do this at home.</p>

<p>LISA is going to be great and will detect stuff from white dwarfs to those supermassive black-hole that live at the center of galaxies. If we&#8217;re lucky (yeah, who knows how many of these we will see), LISA might also detect some smaller black holes, similar to those that LIGO now sees all the time, but at a much earlier stage of their lives. But if we&#8217;re indeed lucky, the science we would take home is outstanding. Using simulated data from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lisa-ldc.lal.in2p3.fr/" target="_blank">LISA Data Challenge</a> we unleash the new amazing parameter-estimation code Balrog (don&#8217;t ask what it means, it&#8217;s just a name, not one of those surreal astronomy acronyms) at this problem. Dive into the paper for some real data-analysis fun!</p>

<p id="block-528ecece-3c90-42d2-9ca4-459e06506037">Who are the parents of LIGO&#8217;s black holes? Stars, most likely. Things like those we see in the sky at night will eventually surrender to gravity and collapse. Some of them will form black holes. Some of them will form binary black holes. Some of them will merge. Some of them will be observed by LIGO. That&#8217;s the vanilla story at least, but it might not apply to all of the black holes that LIGO sees. For some of those, stars might be the grandparents or the great grandparents. And the parents are &#8230; just other black holes! This is today&#8217;s paper lead by Vishal Baibhav. Instead of just measuring the properties of the black holes that LIGO observes, we show we can also say something about the features of the black hole parents. Read on to explore the black-hole family tree.</p>

<p>Orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave observations has been long neglected. And with good reasons! Gravitation-wave emission tends to circularize sources. By the time black holes are detectable by LIGO/Virgo/LISA/whatever, they should have had ample time to become circular. Unless something exciting goes on in their formation, things like clusters, triples, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, etc. And if that happens, we want to see it! This paper contains the first model for gravitational waveforms and black-hole remnants (final mass, spin) trained directly on eccentric numerical relativity simulations. Because eccentric is the new circular.</p>

[Intro music&#8230;Now imagine one of those voices from a TV show trailer&#8230;] </p>



<p><strong>Up-down instability S01-E03.</strong><br><em>&#8220;Previously on the up-down instability. After finding out that the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">S01-E01</a>) and calculating its analytic endpoint (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">S01-E02</a>), one terrifying prospect remains. What if it&#8217;s just PN?  Can all of this disappear in the strong-field regime? This challenge now needs to be faced&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>Today&#8217;s paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian<em> (</em>read<em>: approximate</em>)<em> </em>treatment but we couldn&#8217;t be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.black-holes.org/" target="_blank">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read<em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer is&#8230; yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done. </p>

<p>Spin precession is cool, and we want to measure it. In General Relativity, the orbital plane of a binary is not fixed but moves around. This effect is related to the spin of the orbiting black holes and contains a ton of astrophysical information. The question we try to address in this paper is the following: how does one quantify &#8220;how much&#8221; precession a system has? This is typically done by condensing information into a parameter called \(\chi_{\rm p}\), which is here generalize to include two- spin effects. There are two black holes in a binary and we received numerous complaints from the secondaries: they want to join the gravitational-wave fun!</p>

<p>And here is my latest lockdown effort: some experiments in the wonderful and perilous world of machine learning. The idea of this paper is to teach a computer to figure out by itself if a gravitational-wave signal will be detectable or not. The problem is very similar to that of image recognition: much like classifying if an image is more likely to contain a dog or a cat, here we classify black-hole mergers based on the imprints they have in the LIGO and Virgo detectors. This is important to quantify the so-called &#8220;selection effects&#8221;: in order to figure out what the Universe does based on what we observe, we need to know very well &#8220;how&#8221; we observe and thus what we are going to miss. Our code is built using Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and it is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dgerosa/pdetclassifier" target="_blank">public on Github</a>, feel free to play with it! </p>

<p>If General Relativity is too boring, couple it to something else. In this paper we study what happens to stellar collapse and supernova explosions if gravity is transmitted not only with the usual metric of Einstein&#8217;s theory (aka the graviton) but also an additional quantity. If this extra scalar field has a mass, it dramatically impacts the emitted gravitational waves&#8230; Which means that maybe, one day, one can use gravitational-wave data to figure out if scalar fields are coupled to gravity. Here we try to explore all the related phenomenology of stellar collapse with a large set of simulations covering the parameter space. And the overall picture is remarkably neat and simple!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been knowing about the mass gap for a while, but I bet &#8220;spin gap&#8221; sounds new to you, uh? The gap in the spectrum of binary black hole masses is due to pair-instability supernovae (i.e. what happens if a giant ball of carbon and oxygen burns all at the same time).  As for the spin gap, it might be that stars collapse into black holes which have a tiny tiny spin. But that&#8217;s only for black holes that come from stars: those come out of the merger of other black holes, on the other hand, are very rapidly rotating. So, there&#8217;s a gap between these two populations. Our paper today shows that, together, mass gap and spin gap are powerful tools to figure out where black holes come from. Cluster or field? Gaps will tell.</p>
