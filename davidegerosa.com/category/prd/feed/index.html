<p>In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold <em>from what&#8217;s detected</em>. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what&#8217;s your SNR threshold for detectability? It&#8217;s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst&#8230; </p>

<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with spinning black-hole binaries but, guys, spinning <em>and</em> eccentric black holes are even better! This is the first first-author paper by Giulia, who is not only a rising GW astronomer but also a semi-professional baker&#8230; So take two spoons of black holes, one spoon of spin dynamics, some eccentricity (but less than 0.6 ounces), and a pinch of maths. Put this in a bowl, mix it thoroughly with numerical integrations &#8230;and the result is very tasty! Spins and eccentricity shape the dynamics of black-hole binaries <em>together</em>, which means one can hope to measure eccentricity indirectly from the spins, but also that if you forget about eccentricity then your spin inference will be crap. Buon appetito.   </p>

<p>Gravitational-wave data keep on giving us surprises. The most outstanding one IMO is an observed correlation between mass ratios and spins of the black holes, which was first found by Tom Callister and friends. That is so, so weird&#8230; to the point that virtually zero astrophysical models so far can explain it fully and consistently. Well, we can&#8217;t either (at least not fully and consistently) but we think this paper is a nice attempt. The secret seems to be the symmetry of the astrophysical environment one considers, and  data tends to prefer black holes assembled in cylindrical symmetry. That&#8217;s also weird to be honest, but there&#8217;s a candidate for this setup, namely accretion disks and their migration traps. Who knows, more data will tell. </p>



<p>&#8230; and huge congrats to my MSc student Alessandro who managed to publish a paper even before graduating!</p>

<p>New paper from a new student! Here is Matteo Boschini&#8217;s first piece of work, where we look at predictions for the final mass and spins of black-hole remnants. That is, after two black hole merge, what&#8217;s the mass and spin of the guy they left behind? These predictions are typically done by fitting (in various ways) outputs from numerical-relativity simulations but those, unfortunately, can only handle black holes of similar masses. On the other hand, black holes with masses that are very different from each other can be handled analytically. Here we show how to put the two together with a single machine-learning fit. </p>

<p>All right, this is kind of far from my day-to-day topics but working on this paper with Alice and Riccardo was super fun. Think LISA and supermassive binary black holes. And&#8230; the detector does what it wants. That&#8217;s not true of course because the experimentalists are amazing, but there will be noise transients: unexpected blips when the gravitational-wave signal will be corrupted. Here we look at what would happen in a realistic setting when a LISA glitch happens on top of a gravitational wave from a supermassive black hole. </p>

<p>This paper is episode four in the up-down instability series. We first figured out the instability exists (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/" data-type="post" data-id="2102">episode 1</a>), then computed when binaries go after the instability (i.e. the endpoint, <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/03/05/endpoint-of-the-up-down-instability-in-precessing-binary-black-holes/" data-type="post" data-id="3077">episode 2</a>), and also checked binaries are really unstable in numerical relativity (<a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2020/12/15/up-down-instability-of-binary-black-holes-in-numerical-relativity/" data-type="post" data-id="3755">episode 3</a>). Now we look at the inference problem with LIGO/Virgo: if unstable up-down binaries enter the sensitivity window of the detector, will we be able to tell? We phrased the problem with some fancy stats using the so-called Savage Dickey density ratio, which is the right tool to answer this question. As is too often the case, current data are not informative enough but the future is bright and loud.  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s out! The notorious (ask my students&#8230;) &#8220;<em>precession v2</em>&#8221; paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. It&#8217;s cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If you&#8217;re into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/precession/" data-type="page" data-id="658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Third-generation gravitational wave detectors are going to see <em>all</em> stellar-mass black-hole mergers in the Universe. Wooooooooo. But hang on, is this enough? Observing the sources is great, but then we need to measure them. Here we try to focus on the latter and quantify how well we will be able to measure the distance of black holes. Read the paper now, but the short answer is that 3G detectors are going to be awesome but not <em>that</em> awesome&#8230;</p>

<p>Lots of &#8220;firsts&#8221; today! My <em>first</em>-year PhD student Viola just put out her <em>first</em> <em>first</em>-author paper. This is about measuring black holes with not one, but two precessing spins. People have been trying to figure out how to tell if at least one of the two spins of a merging black-hole binary is precessing for quite some time now. And maybe we&#8217;ve even done it already for one or two of the current LIGO-Virgo events. But here I must quote that epic Italian  commercial from the 90s: &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDHcjEH2syA&amp;ab_channel=PinguinoMagazine" target="_blank">two gust is megl che one</a>&#8221; (which is a terrible Italian-English mishmash on a terrible joke  to say that when you eat a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxibon" target="_blank">Maxibon</a> &#8220;two flavors are better than one&#8221;). In this paper we propose a strategy to identify sources that have the strongest evidence of two processing spins. Viola has been putting together simulated data for the next LIGO/Virgo data-taking period, and the result is pretty cool. If these binaries are out there in the Universe, we will be able to tell they have two spins going around! </p>

<p>Daria&#8217;s new paper is out! (With key contributions from others in the <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group/" data-type="page" data-id="2466">group</a>&#8230; This is also Viola&#8217;s first paper!). </p>



<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guys&#8230; our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but we&#8217;re interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism." target="_blank">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called &#8220;sequential prior conditioning&#8221; (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian stats&#8230;). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow. </p>
