										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>And here is my latest lockdown effort: some experiments in the wonderful and perilous world of machine learning. The idea of this paper is to teach a computer to figure out by itself if a gravitational-wave signal will be detectable or not. The problem is very similar to that of image recognition: much like classifying if an image is more likely to contain a dog or a cat, here we classify black-hole mergers based on the imprints they have in the LIGO and Virgo detectors. This is important to quantify the so-called &#8220;selection effects&#8221;: in order to figure out what the Universe does based on what we observe, we need to know very well &#8220;how&#8221; we observe and thus what we are going to miss. Our code is built using Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and it is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dgerosa/pdetclassifier" target="_blank">public on Github</a>, feel free to play with it! </p>

<p>If General Relativity is too boring, couple it to something else. In this paper we study what happens to stellar collapse and supernova explosions if gravity is transmitted not only with the usual metric of Einstein&#8217;s theory (aka the graviton) but also an additional quantity. If this extra scalar field has a mass, it dramatically impacts the emitted gravitational waves&#8230; Which means that maybe, one day, one can use gravitational-wave data to figure out if scalar fields are coupled to gravity. Here we try to explore all the related phenomenology of stellar collapse with a large set of simulations covering the parameter space. And the overall picture is remarkably neat and simple!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been knowing about the mass gap for a while, but I bet &#8220;spin gap&#8221; sounds new to you, uh? The gap in the spectrum of binary black hole masses is due to pair-instability supernovae (i.e. what happens if a giant ball of carbon and oxygen burns all at the same time).  As for the spin gap, it might be that stars collapse into black holes which have a tiny tiny spin. But that&#8217;s only for black holes that come from stars: those come out of the merger of other black holes, on the other hand, are very rapidly rotating. So, there&#8217;s a gap between these two populations. Our paper today shows that, together, mass gap and spin gap are powerful tools to figure out where black holes come from. Cluster or field? Gaps will tell.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to look into things twice. We found the up-down instability <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/2015/06/30/precessional-instability-in-binary-black-holes-with-aligned-spins/">back in 2015</a> and still did not really understand what was going on.  Three out of four black hole binaries with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum are stable (in the sense that the spins stay aligned), but one is not. The impostors are the &#8220;up-down&#8221; black holes &#8211;binaries where the spin of the big black holes is aligned and the spin of the small black hole is antialigned. These guys are unstable to spin precession: small perturbation will trigger large precession cycles. Matt&#8217;s paper today figures out what&#8217;s the fate of these runaways. We find that these binaries become detectable in LIGO and LISA with very specific spin configurations: the two spins are aligned with each other and equally misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting maths in this draft (my first paper with a proof by contradiction!) as well as some astrophysics (for you, AGN disks lover). </p>

<p>Today&#8217;s paper is about superkicks. These are extreme configurations of black hole binaries which receive a large recoil. Black hole recoils work much like those of, say, a cannon. As the cannonball flies, the cannon recoils backwards. Here the binary is shooting gravitational waves: as they are emitted, the system recoils in the opposite direction. In this paper we show that superkicks might be up to 25% larger if the binary is mildly eccentric. This means it&#8217;s a bit easier to kick black holes out of stellar clusters and galaxies.</p>

<p>Gravitational-wave astronomy is, seems obvious to say, about doing astronomy with gravitational waves. One has gravitational-wave observations (thanks LIGO and Virgo!) on hand and astrophysical models on the other hand. The more closely these two sides interact, the more we  can hope to use gravitational-wave data to learn about the astrophysics of the sources. Today&#8217;s paper with JHU student Kaze Wong tries to further stimulate this dialog. And, well, one needs to throw some artificial intelligence in the game. There are three players now (astrophysics, gravitational waves, and machine learning) and things get even  more interesting.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s in between neutron stars and black holes? It looks like neutron stars have a <em>maximum</em> mass of about 2 solar masses while black holes have a <em>minimum</em> mass of about 5. So what&#8217;s in between? That&#8217;s the popular issue of the &#8216;low mass gap&#8217;. Actually, now we <em>know</em> something must be in there. LIGO and Virgo have seen GW170817, a merger of two neutron stars, which merged in to a black hole with the right mass to populate the gap. Can this population be seen directly with (future) gravitational-wave detectors? That&#8217;s today&#8217;s paper. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Funny things happen in supernova explosions. Funny and complicated. If the star is too massive, the explosion is unstable. The black hole it formed it not as massive as it could have been. In gravitational-wave astronomy, this means that we should not observe black holes heavier than about 50 solar masses. This does not apply, of course, to black holes that are <em>not</em> formed from stars, but from other black holes (yes! more black holes!). If black holes resulting from older gravitational wave events somehow stick around, they could be recycled in other generations of mergers. We point out that this can work only if their astrophysical environment is dense enough. Can we measure the escape speed of black holes &#8220;nurseries&#8221; using gravitational-wave events that should not be there because of supernova instabilities?</p>

<p>Where do black holes come from? Sounds like a scify book title, but it&#8217;s real. These days, that&#8217;s actually the million dollar question in gravitational-wave astronomy. LIGO sees (lots of!) black holes in binaries, and those data encode information on how their stellar progenitors behave, what they like or did not like to do. This is paper is the latest attempt to understand if black holes formed alone (i.e. a single binary star forms a single binary black hole) or together (i.e. many stars exchange pairs in dense stellar environments).</p>

<p>The prospect of multiband gravitational-wave astronomy is so so so exciting (I mean, really!). So exciting that we want to make sure once again it&#8217;s true; and this is today&#8217;s paper. Multiband means seeing the same black hole binary with both LIGO at high frequencies and LISA at low frequencies. LISA observations can serve as precursors for the LIGO mergers, and you can a whole lot of new science (astrophysics, tests of GR, smart data analysis, cosmology, etc). Here we have a new semi-analytic way to estimate the rate (i.e. how many) of multiband events, and we also explore some of the stellar physics one could constraint with them. Enjoy!</p>
