# old-website

Here I stored some static backups of my old website, which was developed with wordpress. For a snapshot, see [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250530003117/https://davidegerosa.com/).


My new website lives at [github.com/dgerosa/website](https://github.com/dgerosa/website) and is deployed at [www.davidegerosa.com](http://www.davidegerosa.com)
